Mystic Manor () is a dark ride attraction in the Mystic Point area of Hong Kong Disneyland.  Unlike Disneyland's Haunted Mansion attraction and its counterparts in other Disney parks, Mystic Manor has a lighthearted, fantasy-based theme with no references to departed spirits or the afterlife, due to differences in traditional Chinese culture.  The attraction does feature several references to the Haunted Mansion, such as a Medusa changing portrait, a conservatory, and the busts that turn to follow visitors as they move.  References to other Disney attractions include several figures similar to those from The Enchanted Tiki Room in the Tribal Arts room.  The Manor's exterior design is inspired by the now-demolished Bradbury Mansion that stood at 147 North Hill Street in Los Angeles' Bunker Hill, designed by Samuel Newsom and Joseph Cather Newsom, who also designed the still-standing Carson Mansion in Eureka, California.\n\n7. Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive.

Players take on the first-person view of fictional amateur sleuth Nancy Drew and must solve the mystery through interrogation of suspects, solving puzzles, and discovering clues.  There are two levels of gameplay, Junior and Senior detective modes, each offering a different difficulty level of puzzles and hints, however neither of these changes affect the actual plot of the game.  The game is loosely based on a book entitled \"The Message in the Haunted Mansion\" (1995).\n\n8. The Haunted Mansion is an action-adventure video game released in 2003 by High Voltage Software.  The game is based on the ride and the movie of the same name.

A youth orchestra is an orchestra made of young musicians, typically ranging from pre-teens or teenagers to those in their mid-20s.  Because young children do not usually start playing double bass until a later age than those playing the smaller instruments, double bass players in youth orchestras tend to be in the early to mid-20s.  The typical youth orchestra involves members from across an entire city or town.  In some cases, there are national youth orchestras, which consist of the best young musicians in a country, as determined by auditions.  More rarely, there may even be international youth orchestras.  Youth orchestras are led by an adult conductor who is often a music teacher or orchestral musician.

The Pont-Audemer Spaniel or Epagneul Pont-Audemer is a rare breed of French gundog.  It originated in the nineteenth century from different breeds of water spaniels, and took more of a setter role in hunting than that of a traditional spaniel.  Following the Second World War, the breed's numbers dropped so low that the breed club decided to allow cross breeding with other breeds because of fears of the existing stock becoming overly inbred.  In 1980, the breed club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel.\n\n2. The Saint-Usuge Spaniel (or \u00c9pagneul de Saint-Usuge) is a breed of Spaniel originating in the Bresse region of France.  The breed has origins dating back to at least the 16th century, but was nearly extinct by the end of World War II.  Through the efforts of Father Robert Billard, the breed was resurrected during the second half of the 20th century; its national breed club was founded in 1990.

The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game.  It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years.  They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines.  The breed suffers from average health complaints.  The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare.  It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter.  The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring,\" game.  In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed.  They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis.  The term \"Springer\" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.\n\n4. The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog.  It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK.  In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \"Cocker Spaniel\" before the American variety was created.  The word \"cocker\" is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while \"spaniel\" is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.\n\n5. A breed standard (also called bench standard or the standard) in the dog fancy is a set of guidelines covering specific \"externally observable\" qualities such as \"appearance\", \"movement\", and \"temperament\" for that dog breed.  Breed standards are not scientific documents, but are written for each breed by clubs of hobbyists called breed clubs for their own specific requirements.  Details and definitions within breed standards for a specific dog breed may vary from breed club to breed club and from country to country.  Dog breed standards are similar in form and function to breed standards for other domesticated animals.\n\n6. The American Water Spaniel, (often abbreviated to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which originated in the United States.  Developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels.  The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club.  While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.\n\n7. The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family.  Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel.  They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity.  Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel.  The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern.  Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers.  Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions.  They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.\n\n8. The Wirehaired Vizsla ( ; ] ; English plural: Vizslas or sometimes Vizslak, based on the Hungarian plural vizsl\u00e1k ] ), is a dog breed originating in Hungary.  Wirehaired Vizslas are known as excellent hunting dogs, and also have a level personality making them suited for families.  The Wirehaired Vizsla is a versatile, natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and an above average trainability.  Although they are lively, gentle mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possessed of a well-developed protective instinct.  The breed has a firmness on point, is an excellent retriever, and has the determination to remain on the scent even when swimming.  The overall appearance embodies the qualities of a multi-purpose pointing dog, endurance, working ability and an easily satisfied nature.  This is a dog of power and drive in the field, yet is a tractable and affectionate companion in the home.\n\n9. The King Charles Spaniel (also known as the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type.

Super Bowl XLVIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos and National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2013 season.  The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43\u20138, the largest margin of victory for an underdog and tied for the third largest point differential overall (35) in Super Bowl history with Super Bowl XXVII (1993).  It was the first time the winning team scored over 40 points, while holding their opponent to under 10.  This became the first Super Bowl victory for the Seahawks and the fifth Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, the most of any team.  The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city and the first Super Bowl to be played on a February 2.\n\n1. Super Bowl XVIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Washington Redskins and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Los Angeles Raiders to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1983 season.  The Raiders defeated the Redskins by the score of 38\u20139.  The Raiders, coached by Tom Flores,' 38 points and their 29-point margin of victory broke Super Bowl records; it still remains the most points scored by an AFC team in a Super Bowl.  The game was played on January 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the first time the Super Bowl was held in that city.  This would be the AFC's last Super Bowl win until Super Bowl XXXII, won by the Denver Broncos.\n\n2. The 1981 Philadelphia Eagles season resulted in an appearance in the postseason for the fourth straight season (first time in franchise history the Eagles had made the postseason four straight times).  The team was coming off a Super Bowl loss to the Oakland Raiders the previous season.  Because they made the Super Bowl in 1980, they were picked by many to not only reach the Super Bowl, but to win it as well.  The Eagles began the 1981 season with 6 straight wins, their best ever start to a season at the time.  The Eagles would win then 3 of their next 5 games to sit at 9-2.  They would then lose their next 4 games to slip to 9-6 and were in danger of missing out on the playoffs.  The next week, they hammered the Cardinals 38-0 to clinch a playoff berth for the fourth straight season.  In the playoffs, they met their arch rivals the Giants.  It was New York's first playoff appearance in 18 years.  In the game, the Giants would stun the eagles 27-21, ending the Eagles seasons as well as hopes for a second straight Super Bowl appearance.  The Eagles would not make the playoffs again until 1988.  They also wouldn't reach the Super Bowl again until 2004.\n\n3. The 1982 Miami Dolphins season was the team's seventeenth in the National Football League.  The team was coming off an unexpected 11-4-1 1981 season and a devastating loss to the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round the previous season in a game dubbed the Epic in Miami.  The Dolphins had clinched the 2 seed and were picked by many to reach the Super Bowl during the 1981 season.  Because of the high number of picks to reach the Super Bowl the previous season, many more fans picked them to win it during the 1982 season.  The Dolphins looked to improve on their 11-4-1 record from 1981.  However, a players strike cancelled 7 of the team's 16 games.  Because of this, the NFL schedule was shrunk to 9 games.  The Dolphins started out fresh, winning their first 2 games prior to the strike.  When season play resumed 2 months later, the Dolphins defeated the Buffalo Bills 9-7 in Buffalo to clinch a 3-0 start.  After a loss to Tampa Bay, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 22-14.  The next week, they lost a brisk game against the Patriots 3-0 in a game called the Snowplow Game.  The Dolphins would then win 3 straight games to end the season 7-2, tied for 2nd in the AFC with the Cincinnati Bengals.  The Dolphins won 2nd place over them by virtue of a series of tiebreakers.  In the playoffs, they defeated the Patriots in a rematch by the score of 28-13.  They then defeated the Chargers in a rematch of the 1981 Divisional Playoffs by a score of 34-13.  In the AFC Championship game, they shutout the Jets, 14-0 to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since 1973.  In Super Bowl XVII, they lost to the Redskins 27-17 in a rematch of Super Bowl VII which concluded Miami's perfect 1972 season.\n\n4. Todd E. Liebenstein (born January 9, 1960) is a former American football defensive end who played four seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins and started in Super Bowl XVIII.  He played college football at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\n5. Super Bowl XXXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2002 season.  The Buccaneers defeated the Raiders by the score of 48\u201321, tied with Super Bowl XXXV for the seventh largest Super Bowl margin of victory, and winning their first ever Super Bowl.  The game, played on January 26, 2003 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, was the sixth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (XVII, XXV, XXVIII, XXXIV, and XXXVI).  It was also the last Super Bowl played in the month of January.  Super Bowl XXXVI was the first to be played in February, due to the NFL postponing games for a week after the September 11 attacks.  Starting with Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, the Super Bowl has been permanently played in February.  This was the last Super Bowl until Super Bowl 50 to take place in California.\n\n6. Jerry Markbreit (born March 23, 1935) is a former American football referee in the National Football League (NFL) for 23 seasons and became one of the most recognizable referees in the game.  Markbreit officiated football games for 43 seasons.  From 1965 to 1975, Markbreit officiated college football games in the Big Ten Conference.  He then joined the NFL in 1976 as a line judge before being promoted to the head referee position in just his second year.  His uniform number in the league was 9, which is now worn by Mark Perlman.  Until he retired from the NFL after the 1998 season, Markbreit officiated in two wild card (1991 and 1994), ten divisional (1979, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1995, 1997, and 1998), eight conference championship (1980, 1983, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996) playoff games, one Pro Bowl (1978), and four Super Bowls: Super Bowl XVII, Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXVI, and Super Bowl XXIX and was an alternate in Super Bowl XIX, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXVIII.  To date, he is the only NFL head referee to officiate four Super Bowl games.\n\n7. The 2007 New York Giants season was the 83rd season for the New York Giants in the National Football League.  The Giants finished the regular season 10\u20136 and in second place in the NFC East, improving upon their 8\u20138 record in 2006 in which they finished third in their division.  They qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team as the #5 seed, and beat the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9\u20137), the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys (13\u20133), and the #2 seed Green Bay Packers (13\u20133) to become the National Football Conference representative in Super Bowl XLII.  There, they defeated the heavily favored and previously undefeated 18\u20130 New England Patriots and spoiled their perfect season.  The 2007 New York Giants became the 9th wild card team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl and the 5th wild card team to win the Super Bowl, and the very first NFC wild card to accomplish the feat.  They were the third team in history to win three road playoff games en route to a Super Bowl and set a league record for most consecutive road wins in a single season (11), though the Super Bowl is played on a neutral field rather than an opponent's stadium.  It was the 7th league championship season for the New York Giants and their first since they won Super Bowl XXV in 1991.\n\n8. Super Bowl XXVIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Dallas Cowboys and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Buffalo Bills to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1993 season.  The Cowboys defeated the Bills by the score of 30\u201313, winning their fourth Super Bowl in team history, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers and the San Francisco 49ers for most Super Bowl wins.  The game was played on January 30, 1994, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.  Since the 1993 regular season was conducted over 18 weeks (two byes per team), the traditional bye week between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl was removed.  This was only the third Super Bowl with only one week after that conference title games; the others were Super Bowl IV and Super Bowl XVII.\n\n9. Super Bowl XXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Buffalo Bills and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Dallas Cowboys to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1992 season.  The Cowboys crushed the Bills by the score of 52\u201317, winning their third Super Bowl in team history, and their first one in fifteen years.  This game is tied with Super Bowl XXXVII as the second highest scoring Super Bowl ever with 69 combined points.  The Bills became the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls, and just the second team to play in three straight (the Miami Dolphins played in Super Bowls VI\u2013VIII, winning VII and VIII).  The game was played on January 31, 1993 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the seventh and most recent Super Bowl (until 2022 when Los Angeles hosts again) that the Greater Los Angeles Area has hosted.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Todd E.

Since spring 2011, Dreams began testing with original projector animations but, in late 2011, some scenes that were tested in early 2011 were deleted and others were changed.  Using the technique of projection mapping, the castle can be visually transformed in numerous ways such as shrinking, spinning and turrets flipping.\n\n2. The Disneyland Resort Line is a heavy rail MTR line connecting Sunny Bay to the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, coloured pink on the network diagram.  It is the seventh line of the former MTR network before the merger of MTR and KCR, and the world's first metro line designed to service a Disney theme park.  There are only two stations on this line, Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort, and the line operates as a shuttle service between these two stations.

The narrative structure of \"Fantasmic!\" \u2014although varying differently in set pieces in all three versions\u2014centers on a voyage through Mickey Mouse's imagination that culminates in a battle against the Disney Villains.\n\n6. The Main Street Electrical Parade is a nighttime parade, created by Bob Jani and project director Ron Miziker, famous for its long run at Disneyland at the Disneyland Resort in California and Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.  It features floats and live performers covered in thousands of electronically controlled lights and a synchronized soundtrack triggered by radio control along key areas of the parade route.  The parade has also spun off several other versions that ran or continue to run at Disney parks around the world.  Currently, an updated version runs at Tokyo Disneyland as the \"Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights\".  In 2014, Hong Kong Disneyland premiered a spiritual successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, the \"Paint the Night Parade\", which, like its predecessor, features \"Baroque Hoedown\" as its theme song.  An extended version of \"Paint the Night\" premiered at Disneyland on May 22, 2015 as part of the park's 60th anniversary celebration.\n\n7. Rail transport can be found in every theme park resort property owned or licensed by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, the theme park and vacation resort segment of the larger Walt Disney Company.  The origins of Disney theme park rail transport can be traced back to Walt Disney himself and his personal fondness for railroads, who insisted that they be included in the first Disney park, the original Disneyland (a key component of the Disneyland Resort) in California in the United States, which opened on July 17, 1955.  The Disney tradition of including transport by rail in its parks has since been extended to other Disney properties with the opening of Walt Disney World in Florida in the United States, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, Disneyland Paris in France, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort in China, and Shanghai Disney Resort in China.\n\n8.

The Babe Ruth Home Run Award was an annual award presented to the previous season's leading home run hitter in Major League Baseball (MLB).  The award was named after the legendary Babe Ruth, who led the American League in homers 12\u00a0times.  It was first awarded to Mark McGwire after his record-setting 1998 season.  The award was a 21 lb , 20 in bronze statue of Ruth based on a 1920 photo of him following through on a tremendous swing.\n\n1. Memorial Stadium was a sports stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, that formerly stood on 33rd Street (aka 33rd Street Boulevard or renamed \"Babe Ruth Plaza\") on an oversized block (officially designated as Venable Park, a former city park from the 1920s) also bounded by Ellerslie Avenue (west), 36th Street (north), and Ednor Road (east).  Two different stadiums were located here, a 1922 version known as \"Baltimore Stadium\", or \"Municipal Stadium\", or sometimes 'Venable Stadium', and, for a time, \"Babe Ruth Stadium\" in reference to the then-recently deceased Baltimore native.\n\n2. Pedro Cepeda, a.k.a. \"Perucho\" and \"The Bull\" (January 31, 1905 \u2013 April 16, 1955) was a Puerto Rican baseball player who was considered one of the best players of his generation.  Called \"The Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico\" and \"Babe Cobb\" (referring to his dominance as a hitter and his legendary hustle evocative of both Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb), Cepeda was a Latin American baseball superstar.  He was denied the chance to play in the major leagues because he was of African descent and played the bulk of his pro career (which spanned the years 1928 to 1950) before the color line was broken by Jackie Robinson in 1947.  Known as \"Perucho\" and \"The Bull\", Cepeda refused offers to play in the Negro Leagues in the mainland United States as he abhorred the racism endemic to American society at the time.  He is now best known as the father of Baseball Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda.\n\n3. Babe Ruth's called shot was the home run hit by Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees in the fifth inning of Game 3 of the 1932 World Series, held on October 1, 1932, at Wrigley Field in Chicago.  During the at-bat, Ruth made a pointing gesture, which existing film confirms, but the exact meaning of his gesture remains ambiguous.  Although neither fully confirmed nor refuted, the story goes that Ruth pointed to the center-field bleachers during the at-bat.  It was allegedly a declaration that he would hit a home run to this part of the park.  On the next pitch, Ruth hit a home run to center field.  The home run was his fifteenth, and last, in his 41 post-season games.  It was said to be one of the greatest home runs in history.\n\n4. Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards was a non-profit sports museum in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, owned and operated by the Babe Ruth Birthplace & Museum.  It opened on May 14, 2005, with the daughter of celebrated baseball player Babe Ruth in attendance.  After ten years of operation the museum closed abruptly on October 12, 2015 after failing to reach an agreement with the Maryland Stadium Authority for the continued use of Camden Station.  The 22000 sqft museum was adjacent to the main gate of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and has artifacts and interactive exhibits profiling Maryland\u2019s sports history.  Exhibits included such area teams as the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Ravens, Baltimore Colts, Maryland Terrapins, Baltimore Elite Giants, Baltimore Black Sox, and the Baltimore Blast.\n\n5.

The Babe Ruth Story is a 1948 baseball film biography of Babe Ruth, the famed New York Yankees slugger.  It stars William Bendix (New York Yankee batboy in the 1920s) as the ballplayer and Claire Trevor as his wife.  It was rushed to release after news of Ruth's declining health, and makes no mention whatsoever of Ruth's first wife, Helen.  Critics criticised the film's heavy-handedness, and direction, and it is said by many to be one of the worst films ever made.\n\n8. One of the first spring training facilities, Majestic Park (1908\u201318) was the original baseball facility, on a parcel at the corner of Belding Street and Carson Street in Hot Springs, Arkansas.  The original Majestic Park was the spring training site of the Boston Red Sox (and their star pitcher Babe Ruth), (1909-1910, 1912\u201318), Cincinnati Reds (1910-1911), Brooklyn Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (1911).  The location later became the site of Dean Field (1935-1947) and Jaycee Park (1947-Present).  Dean Field served as home to the Rogers Hornsby Baseball College.  The Hot Springs Bathers minor league team and the Chicago White Sox (1948\u201351) minor league Spring Training were held at Jaycee Park, which also hosted the 1952 Negro League World Series and a 1953 exhibition game featuring Jackie Robinson.  The site hosted many Major League Spring Training Games and can claim both Home Run record holders, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron as among those who have played at the site.  In 1914, Babe Ruth was just beginning his career (as a dominant left-handed pitcher) for the Red Sox, while a young Aaron performed there in 1952.\n\n9. This page details statistics, records, and other achievements pertaining to Babe Ruth.  At the time in which Babe Ruth played, some of baseball's modern awards did not exist.  The Division Series and Championship Series did not exist.  The MLB All-Star Game did not exist until 1933, late in Ruth's career.  At the time of his retirement, Ruth held many of baseball's most esteemed records, including the career records for home runs (714 \u2014 since broken), slugging percentage (0.690), runs batted in (2,213 \u2014 since broken), bases on balls (2,062 \u2014 since broken) and on-base plus slugging (1.164).

Tropical Storm Colin was a tropical cyclone that brought squally weather to Bermuda and caused extensive rip currents across the East Coast of the United States in August\u00a02010.  The fourth tropical cyclone and third named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Colin developed as a tropical depression from a low-pressure area in the central Atlantic on August\u00a02.  After forming, the storm initially strengthened gradually, attaining tropical storm status early on August\u00a03.  However, due to its acceleration to the west-northwest, Colin was unable to maintain a closed circulation and subsequently degenerated into a trough later that day.  The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration over subsequent days, and by August\u00a05, Colin had once again become a tropical cyclone.  Despite moderate wind shear impacting the system, Colin reached a peak intensity of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a05.  However, vertical wind shear prevented further intensification and eventually weakened the storm.  By early on August\u00a08, Colin had weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated near Bermuda shortly after.  Though it remained well offshore, Colin produced rough seas along the East Coast of the United States.  At least 205\u00a0ocean rescues were made.  In Bermuda, effects were generally minimal.  Less than 1 in of rain fell and winds remained below tropical storm force.\n\n8.

It developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25, 1954, and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward.  On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift.  A strong trough of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward, and Carol later intensified into a major hurricane.  While paralleling the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, and New Jersey.  The well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern Long Island, New York, and then over eastern Connecticut on August\u00a031 with sustained winds estimated at 110-mph and a barometric pressure near 956 mb.  Carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New Hampshire later on August 31, 1954.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Cheviot Beach is a beach near Point Nepean in Victoria, Australia.

The Cherokee believed the Nunnehi to be a type of supernatural human being, completely distinct from ghosts and nature spirits, as well as from gods.  In this sense, the Nunnehi (along with the \"Yunwi Tsunsdi\", or \"Little People\" in the Cherokee language) are the Cherokee equivalent of fairies in traditional European folklore.  The belief in fairy-like beings is universal among all ethnicities, including all American Indian tribes.\n\n1.

Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, and the tips of western South Carolina and northeastern Georgia.  The Cherokee language is a Southern Iroquoian language and part of the Iroquoian language family.  Today there are three federally recognized Cherokee tribes: the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma, and the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma.\n\n5. The Wyandot people or Wendat, also called the Huron Nation and Huron people, in most historic references are believed to have been the most populous confederacy of Iroquoian cultured indigenous peoples of North America.  They traditionally spoke the Wyandot language, a Northern Iroquoian language and were believed to number over 30,000 at the time the first European trader-explorers made contact with them in the second decade of the 17th century.\n\n6.

Mr Thakurdas Choithram Pagarani wanted to start a foundation called the Choithram International Foundation.  He was dying of cancer.  He drew up a trust deed, including himself a trustee.  He travelled from his business based in Dubai and had a ceremony at his son's home in London.  On 17 February 1992, with people gathered at his bedside, Mr Pagarani announced he was transferring his money to a Jersey trust for his proposed philanthropic foundation.  Witnesses differed in the precise words, but the generally accepted substance as to what he was thought to have said was: \"I now give all my wealth to the Trust\" or \"I have given everything to the Trust\".  Mr Pagarani executed the trust deed in front of three trustees (who also signed), his accountant and the First Secretary of the Indian High Commission.  He told the group accountant, Mr Param, that he knew what to do to transfer all balances to the foundation.  There were to be three more trustees (who signed shortly afterwards), and Mr Pagarani himself was to be a seventh trustee.  Those present testified that Mr Pagarani made an immediate absolute gift to the Foundation of all his shareholdings and credit balances in four British Virgin Island companies.  But then he died before actually executing the documents to transfer legal title to the assets to the trustees.  Some of his children contended the gift was imperfect and unenforceable.  The four BVI companies in fact altered the share registers later the same day.  Mr Pagarani had also prepared a will, but had not signed it.  The share transfer documents were also unsigned by Mr Pagarani.  The relatives who were trustees of the Foundation claimed that the gift to the Foundation was valid, and that the shares in the companies had not been transferred properly in the manner specified by law in the International Business Companies Act.  Other people who stood to inherit challenged the foundation's claim.\n\n1. The Alexander S.

What is the experience of one's own gender referred to as?

Only recently has the Japanese language begun to distinguish sex and gender.  Additionally, no explicit connection had been made prior between gender and sexual preference.  The Japanese adopted the English term gender (\"jendaa)\" to describe cultural concepts of feminine and masculine.  Previously, \"sei\" was used to distinguish the binary biological sexes, female and male, as well as the concept of gender.  Many terms describing gender presentation had vastly irregular meanings such as \"okama\", whose definitions included: a gay male, a feminine-behaving male, or a crossdresser.  Umbrella terms such as these had a negative sociological impact, generalizing various queer identities into a single concept.  Similar to the experience of LGBTQIA persons in other countries, Japanese queers lacked the linguistic space to exist in.\n\n1. The gender binary, also referred to as gender binarism (sometimes shortened to just binarism), is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.  Gender binary is one general type of a gender system.  Gender binary is one of the core principles of genderism; it describes a social boundary that discourages people from crossing or mixing gender roles, and from identifying with more than two forms of gender expression.  Sometimes in this binary model, \"sex\", \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" are assumed by default to align.  For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a heterosexual attraction to females.\n\n2. Trigenderism is a non-binary gender identity in which one shifts between or among the behaviors of three genders, which could include male, female, and third gender (or genderless, non-gender, polygender, or any other variety of genderqueer identities).  Someone who is also gender fluid may mix two or more genders at a time.  Trigender falls under the general category of genderqueer or androgyny, a gender identity that goes beyond the normal binary gender system (male and female) and tends to be a catch-all place for other gender identities.  It can also be seen as the equivalent cultures that recognize individuals to define their own sense of self.\n\n3. Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases or conditions which occur \"only\" in people of one sex (for example, prostate cancer in males or uterine cancer in females); sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more common to one sex (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus occurs predominantly in females); and diseases which occur at similar rates in males and females but manifest differently according to sex (for example, peripheral artery disease).  Sex differences in medicine should not be confused with gender differences.  The Institute of Medicine recognizes sex differences as biological at the chromosomal level, whereas gender differences are based on self-representation and other factors including biology, environment and experience.  Sex differences in medicine should also not be confused with sexually transmitted diseases, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.\n\n4. Gender systems are systems of gender roles in societies.  A \"gender role\" is \"everything that a person says and does to indicate to others or to the self the degree that one is either male, female, or androgynous.  This includes but is not limited to sexual and erotic arousal and response.\"  Gender identity is one's own personal experience with gender role and the persistence of one's individuality as male, female, or androgynous, especially in self-awareness and behavior.\n\n5. Gender polarization is a concept in sociology by American psychologist Sandra Bem which states that societies tend to define femininity and masculinity as polar opposite genders, such that male-acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa.  The theory is an extension of the sex and gender distinction in sociology in which sex refers to the biological differences between men and women, while gender refers to the cultural differences between them, such that \"gender\" describes the \"socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\".  According to Bem, gender polarization begins when natural sex differences are exaggerated in culture; for example, women have less hair than men, and men have more muscles than women, but these physical differences are exaggerated culturally when women remove hair from their faces and legs and armpits, and when men engage in body building exercises to emphasize their muscle mass.  She explained that gender polarization goes further, when cultures construct \"differences from scratch to make the sexes even more different from one another than they would otherwise be\", perhaps by dictating specific hair styles for men and women, which are noticeably distinct, or separate clothing styles for men and women.  When genders become polarized, according to the theory, there is no overlap, no shared behaviors or attitudes between men and women; rather, they are distinctly opposite.  She argued that these distinctions become so \"all-encompassing\" that they \"pervade virtually every aspect of human existence\", not just hairstyles and clothing but how men and women express emotion and experience sexual desire.  She argued that male-female differences are \"superimposed on so many aspects of the social world that a cultural connection is thereby forged between sex and virtually every other aspect of human experience\".\n\n6. Feminist bookstores are retail bookstores that sell material relating to women's issues, gender, and sexuality.  These stores served as some of the earliest open spaces for feminist community building and organizing.\n\n7. \"Gender\" refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male or female.  Scholars generally regard gender as a social construct\u2014meaning that it does not exist naturally, but is instead a concept that is created by cultural and societal norms. \" Gender binary\" is the system of viewing gender as consisting solely of two, opposite categories, termed \u201cmale and female\u201d, in which no other possibilities for gender or anatomy are believed to exist.  This system is oppressive to anyone who defies their sex assigned at birth, but particularly those who are gender-variant or do not fit neatly into one of the two standard categories.  Gender identity, one\u2019s internal sense of being male, female, neither of these, both, or other genders, is something that everyone has, and not everyone identifies their gender as male or female.\n\n8. Gender identity is one's personal experience of one's own gender.  Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely.  All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society.  In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression.  In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; some of those individuals are transgender or genderqueer.  Some societies have third gender categories.\n\n9. An organism is said to be sexually dimorphic when male and female conspecifics have anatomical differences in features such as body size, coloration, or ornamentation, but disregarding differences of reproductive organs.  Sexual dimorphism is usually a product of sexual selection, with female choice leading to elaborate male ornamentation (e.g., tails of male peacocks) and male-male competition leading to the development of competitive weaponry (e.g., antlers on male moose).  However, evolutionary selection also acts on the sensory systems that receivers use to perceive external stimuli.  If the benefits of perception to one sex or the other are different, sex differences in sensory systems can arise.  For example, female production of signals used to attract mates can put selective pressure on males to improve their ability to detect those signals.  As a result, only males of this species will evolve specialized mechanisms to aid in detection of the female signal.  This article uses examples of sex differences in the olfactory, visual, and auditory systems of various organisms to show how sex differences in sensory systems arise when it benefits one sex and not the other to have enhanced perception of certain external stimuli.  In each case, the form of the sex difference reflects the function it serves in terms of enhanced reproductive success.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "\"Gender\" refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male or female.

Darryl Eugene Strawberry Sr. (born March 12, 1962) is an American former professional baseball right fielder and an ordained Christian minister and author.  Strawberry is well known for his 17-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB).  Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Strawberry was one of the most feared sluggers in the sport, known for his prodigious home runs and his intimidating presence in the batter's box with his 6-foot-6 frame and his long, looping swing that elicited comparisons to Ted Williams.\n\n1.

During a 9-year major league baseball career, he hit .223, 28 home runs, and 107 runs batted in.\n\n2. In baseball, a Chinese home run, also a Chinese homer, Harlem home run, or Pekinese poke, is a derogatory and archaic term for a hit that just barely clears the outfield fence at its closest distance to home plate, essentially the shortest home run possible in the ballpark in question, particularly if the park is known to have an atypically short fence to begin with.  The term was most commonly used in reference to home runs hit along the right field foul line at the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants, where that distance was short even by contemporary standards.  When the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958, the Los Angeles Coliseum, temporary home of the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers, took over the reputation for four seasons until the team took up residence in its permanent home at Dodger Stadium in 1962.  Following two seasons of use by the expansion New York Mets in the early 1960s, the Polo Grounds were demolished, and the term gradually dropped out of use.\n\n3. Garret Joseph Anderson (born June 30, 1972) is an American former professional baseball left fielder.

He holds Angels franchise records for career games played (2,013), at bats (7,989), hits (2,368), runs scored (1,024), runs batted in (RBI) (1,292), total bases (3,743), extra base hits (796), singles (1,572), doubles (489), grand slams (8), RBI in a single game (10) and consecutive games with an RBI (12), as well as home runs by a left-handed hitter (272).  A three-time All-Star, he led the Angels to the 2002 World Series title, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 2003 All-Star Game.\n\n4. In baseball, the lefty-righty switch is a maneuver by which a player that struggles against left- or right-handed players is replaced by a player who excels in the situation, usually only for the duration of the situation in question.  For instance, a right-handed pitcher who is weak against left-handed hitting and is facing a left-handed hitter would be replaced with a pitcher, usually left-handed, who does a superior job of getting a left-handed hitter out.  Similarly, a batter who has difficulty hitting against a left-handed pitcher will sometimes be pinch hit for by a batter who does well, even if the original player is superior in other respects.\n\n5. John Allen Miller (born March 14, 1944 in Alhambra, California) is a former Major League Baseball player who played for the 1966 New York Yankees and 1969 Los Angeles Dodgers.  He is made famous by the fact he is one of only two players to hit a home run in his first and last major league at-bats.  The other is Paul Gillespie.  Miller's first and last major league at-bat home runs (off of Lee Stange and Jim Merritt respectively) were the only two home runs he hit in his career.\n\n6.

His nickname, \"Pronk\", was given to him by former teammate Bill Selby during spring training of 2001 when people sometimes referred to him as \"The Project\" and other times \"Donkey\" for the way he looked when running the bases.

A human eye in a state of emmetropia requires no corrective lenses; the vision scores well on a visual acuity test (such as an eye chart test).  For example, on a Snellen chart test, emmetropic eyes score at \"6/6\"(m) or \"20/20\"(ft) vision, whereas myopic (near-sighted) eyes might score at 20/40 and hyperopic (far-sighted) eyes might score at 20/15.\n\n5.

The Nostalgia Factory, subtitled \"...and other tips for amateur golfers\", is the second album to be released by Steven Wilson under the name 'Porcupine Tree'.  It was the second full-length cassette produced for his 'joke' project with friend Malcom Stocks.  The album was issued by Delerium in 1991 (despite the Porcupine Tree website stating 1990) in a limited edition of 300 copies.  Like its predecessor, the tracks from \"The Nostalgia Factory\" were subsequently released in the band's first studio album \"On the Sunday of Life\", and the compilation album \"Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape\".  Some tracks have been renamed and/or rearranged in later albums and performances.\n\n1. Atlanta is a download only double-live album by British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree recorded at the Roxy Theatre, Atlanta, United States on 29 October 2007.  The show recording was initially intended for a prospective Porcupine Tree live album, but this decision was later turned down as development of the \"Anesthetize\" DVD project began.  In the wake of the news regarding Mick Karn's advanced stage cancer, the band decided to put it out as a downloadable item from the Burning Shed online store at a very cheap cost, as a . RAR file split in two parts, all in MP3 format at 320kbit/s with completely printable artwork designed by Carl Glover.  The profits from the \"Atlanta\" downloads are intended to help Mick pay his treatment.  A 24-bit FLAC version was released in August 2010; profits from this version go to the Teenage Cancer Trust.  Since the album's artwork and mix is set up for two CDs it is widely considered to be a double album.  The album has a somewhat similar track listing to the \"Anesthetize\" DVD but includes the first official live recording of the track \"A Smart Kid\" and some of the songs that were performed at the shows for the Anesthetize shoot, but left out as they were already available on previous live releases (Open Car and Blackest Eyes).\n\n2. Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, subtitled \"Words from a Hessian Sack\", is the first album to be released by Steven Wilson under the name \"Porcupine Tree\".  It was originally a compiled cassette of experimental music made by Steven Wilson for his joke band he formed with his friend Malcom Stocks.  The cassette was only sent out to a few people, but was enough to give the band a bit of fame in the UK underground music scene of the time, being picked up by the underground magazine Freakbeat.  It was later released under Delerium Records in 1991 in a limited edition of 300 copies.  Eventually, the tracks from this and the later Porcupine Tree album \"The Nostalgia Factory\" were compiled into what are considered Porcupine Tree's first true studio albums, \"On the Sunday of Life\" and \"Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape\".\n\n3. We Lost the Skyline (also known as Transmission 7.1) is a live recording by Porcupine Tree, recorded during an in-store performance at Park Avenue CDs in Orlando, Florida, with 200 fans in attendance.  Although it was originally planned that the full band would play, lack of space dictated that only the two guitarists/singers Steven Wilson and John Wesley did.  This one-off performance was captured by a remote recording facility and the complete 8 song, 33 minute show is now being released in a mail order only CD, but the band are currently negotiating a low-key release for the CD through a number of independent stores in the USA that have supported Porcupine Tree over the last few years (including Park Avenue CDs itself).  However, the CD was released in Poland in small quantity.\n\n4. XM (also known as Transmission 1.1 and Transmission 1.2) is a live-in-studio album recorded by British band Porcupine Tree in early 2003 as a live album of mostly \"In Absentia\" tracks.  This was taken from a session at XM Satellite Radio in Washington D.C. on 12th November 2002, and was originally released as a limited edition tour album.  It was later released online on the Porcupine Tree store.\n\n5. The Accidentals are an American musical band, formed in Traverse City, Michigan, United States in 2012, by Savannah Buist and Katie Larson.  Currently the band includes the founders and musician Michael Dause, added in 2014.  The group features an eclectic blend of indie folk, pop, jazz, bluegrass, rock, classical and other genres, utilizing a wide variety of instruments that reflect the group's orchestral roots and electronic influences.\n\n6. Anesthetize is the second live DVD by progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, released on 20 May 2010.  The Blu-ray edition was released on 15 June.  It is filmed in high definition and taken from two concerts given by Porcupine Tree at Tilburg, Netherlands on 15 and 16 October, at the end of the \"Fear of a Blank Planet\" tour in 2008.  The film is directed and edited by Lasse Hoile and the audio track is mixed in stereo and 5.1 Surround by Steven Wilson.\n\n7. Porcupine Tree were an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987.  The band began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the band's music.  However, by 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri on keyboards, Colin Edwin on bass and Chris Maitland on drums as permanent band members.  With Wilson still in charge of guitar and lead vocals, this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited Gavin Harrison to replace Maitland on drums.\n\n8. Time Flies is a single from Porcupine Tree's 2009 studio album \"The Incident\".  Written by bandleader Steven Wilson, \"Time Flies\" is the centrepiece of the 55 minute movement that comprises the first disc of the album.  The track deals with the passage of time and the phenomenon that as one gets older, time seems to pass even more quickly, with the lyrics making reference to Wilson's life so far.  The song was edited down from its album length of 11:40 for both the single and video releases.  The music video was directed by longtime Porcupine Tree collaborator Lasse Hoile.  Due to an error in the mixing stage, the promo CD single edit has a strange drum mix, making it different from the full-length album mix.\n\n9. XMII (also known as Transmission 4.1) is a live-in-studio album by British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree, released in June 2005.  It is the band's second session for XM Satellite Radio and was recorded on 21 July 2003.  Unlike its predecessor, \"XM\", \"XMII\" contains mostly tracks from the \"Lightbulb Sun\" album.  The album was issued on the band's own \"Transmission\" label and sold only at shows and through Porcupine Tree's online store, Burning Shed.  An interesting feature of the album is the song \"Fadeaway\" sung by guest guitarist John Wesley.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Porcupine Tree were an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987.

The team is considered one of the worst teams in NFL history, both on (lowest franchise winning percentage) and off the field.

Many players on the 1952 roster went to the new Baltimore Colts franchise in 1953.

The Padlock is a two-act 'afterpiece' opera by Charles Dibdin.  The text was by Isaac Bickerstaffe.  It debuted in 1768 at the Drury Lane Theatre in London as a companion piece to \"The Earl of Warwick\".  It partnered other plays before a run of six performances in tandem with \"The Fatal Discovery\" by John Home.  \"The Padlock\" was a success, largely due to Dibdin's portrayal of Mungo, a blackface caricature of a black servant from the West Indies.  The company took the production to the United States the next year, where a portrayal by Lewis Hallam, Jr. as Mungo met with even greater accolades.  The libretto was first published in London in 1768 (?)  and in Dublin in 1775.  The play remained in regular circulation in the U.S. as late as 1843.  It was revived by the Old Vic Company in London and on tour in the UK in 1979 in a new orchestration by Don Fraser and played in a double-bill with Garrick's \"Miss In Her Teens\".  The role of Mungo was, again, played by a white actor.  Opera Theatre of Chicago have recently revived the piece (2007?)  where, it would seem, the role of Mungo was changed to that of an Irish servant.\n\n2. Grafton Volcano is a buried volcano in New Zealand's Auckland volcanic field that underlies much of the Auckland suburb of Grafton.  First recognised in 2010, it includes the Outhwaite Park scoria cone that was first mapped by Hochstetter (1864) and inferred by later geologists to be a late phase vent of adjacent Domain Volcano.  Borehole drilling and building excavations in the Grafton-Auckland Domain area during the 1990s and 2000s provided new subsurface geological information that allowed geologists to recognise the buried Grafton Volcano.\n\n3.

Saa Emerson Lamina, born in Koidutown, Kono District, is a Sierra Leoneean politician and the Mayor of Koidu City.  Mr. Lamina is the youngest Mayor in Sierra Leone's history, and at the time of his inauguration was the youngest Mayor in West Africa.  Mayor Lamina is adored and loved by the people of Kono for his humility and his progressive policies.  He has always been focused on building his city lot by lot, block by block.  He's known for bringing city government closer to the people, by holding regular town-hall meetings, press conferences and quarterly mobile council meetings in the various neighborhoods of the city (first of it kind in the country), which earned him the nickname \"the mayor of neighborhoods.\"  Soon after taking office, Mayor Lamina called for more transparent, participatory, and collaborative government.  Mayor Lamina, also known as Mr. Incorruptible, introduced strict anti-corruption programs and open-government policies to the dismay of the district political elites, paramount chiefs, and party leaders in the national capital Freetown, who have been the beneficiaries of decades long culture of corruption that has kept the district on the bottom in terms of development.  The diamond rich Kono District (the bread basket of the nation) has been the most neglected district in the country and its capital Koidu City was the most under-develop city in the country.  The city was completely burnt down during the civil war in the nineteen-nineties.  But under Mayor Lamina's leadership, Koidu City has seen a lot of improvements.  His administration has installed hundreds of new solar lights in the city, paved major streets, rehabilitated and reconstructed schools, provided new furniture to primary and secondary schools, rehabilitated the Koidu Government Hospital and procured essential drugs for the hospital, established bi-lateral ties with cities around the world, and implemented policies targeting Diasporas as agents for development.\n\n7. Richard Coeur de Lion: An historical romance is a 1786 semi-opera with an English text by John Burgoyne set to music by Thomas Linley the Elder.  It was first staged at Drury Lane Theatre in October 1786.

The work was a major success and ran for 43 performances and was revived seven times before the end of the century.  By contrast a rival version staged at the Covent Garden Theatre at the same time was a failure.\n\n8. Grand trait\u00e9 d\u2019instrumentation et d\u2019orchestration modernes, abbreviated in English as the Treatise on Instrumentation (sometimes Treatise on Orchestration) is a technical study of Western musical instruments, written by Hector Berlioz.  It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date, and had a chapter added by Berlioz on conducting in 1855.  In 1904 Richard Strauss was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and included musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated \"Treatise\" with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.  The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.  The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic range, tone quality, and limitations.  An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the orchestra is also provided.  The book also provides orchestral excerpts from classical scores to give examples of techniques discussed.  These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while Mozart, Wagner, Beethoven, and Gluck are also frequently cited.\n\n9.

Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm.  Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells.  They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis.  The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes.  In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information.  Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur.  For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs.  Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.\n\n1. Anne Colquhoun Sayre (April 10, 1923 \u2013 March 13, 1998) was an American writer well known for her biography of Rosalind Franklin, one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA.  She was married to an American crystallographer David Sayre (1924\u20132012).  Her literary contributions are in short stories, the earnings from which she supported her husband during his PhD course.  She achieved her lifelong educational ambition of getting a law degree in her early 50s.  She ultimately became justice of the local court in Riverhead.  She was a lifelong friend of Franklin, who played a key role in the discovery of the chemical structure of DNA.  A strong feminist, her 1975 book \"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\" became an exposition of the account of sexism in the scientific community on one hand, and the true genius of the British Chemist Rosalind Franklin in her contributions to molecular biology on the other hand.\n\n2. Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically.  Animal genetic resources, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are \"those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them.  These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\"  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.  Cryoconservation is an \"ex situ\" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside \"in situ\" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other \"ex situ\" and \"in situ\" strategies.  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.\n\n3. Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916 \u2013 28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson, work which was based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin, Raymond Gosling and Maurice Wilkins.  Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\n4. In bioethics and law, gene theft or DNA theft is the act of acquiring the genetic material of another human being without his or her permission, often from a public place.  The DNA may be harvested from a wide variety of common objects such as discarded cigarettes, used coffee cups, and hairbrushes.  This genetic material can then be used for purposes such as establishing paternity, proving genealogical connections or even unmasking private medical conditions.\n\n5. Genetic ecology is the study of the stability and expression of varying genetic material within abiotic mediums.  Typically, genetic data is not thought of outside of any organism save for criminal for criminal forensics.  However, genetic material has the ability to be taken up by various organisms that exist within an abiotic medium through natural transformations that may occur.  Thus, this field of study focuses on interaction, exchange, and expression of genetic material that may not be shared by species had they not been in the same environment.\n\n6. James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin.  Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\n7. A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i.e., a genetically \"engineered\" organism).  GMOs are used to produce many medications and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and the production of other goods.  The term GMO is very close to the technical legal term, 'living modified organism', defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which regulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, \"any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology\").\n\n8. Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 192016 April 1958) was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.  Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognised posthumously.\n\n9. DNA banking is the secure, long term storage of an individual\u2019s genetic material.  DNA is most commonly extracted from blood, but can also be obtained from saliva and other tissues.  DNA banks allow for conservation of genetic material and comparative analysis of an individual's genetic information.  Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict genetic disorders, as used in preventative genetics or gene therapy, and prove that person's identity, as used in the criminal justice system.  There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reactions (PCR).\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916 \u2013 28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson, work which was based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin, Raymond Gosling and Maurice Wilkins.

Design for behaviour change is a sub-category of design, which is concerned with how design can shape, or be used to influence human behaviour.  All approaches of design for behaviour change acknowledge that artefacts have an important influence on human behaviour and/or behavioural decisions.

Areas in which design for behaviour change has been most commonly applied include health and wellbeing, sustainability, safety and social context, as well as crime prevention.\n\n5. Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law.  They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being\", and which are \"inherent in all human beings\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status.  They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone.  They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture and execution.\n\n6. Human behaviour genetics is a subfield of the field of behaviour genetics that studies the role of genetic and environmental influences on human behaviour.  Classically, human behavioural geneticists have studied the inheritance of behavioural traits.  The field was originally focused on testing whether genetic influences were important in human behavior (e.g., do genes influence human behavior).  It has evolved to address more complex questions such as: how important are genetic and/or environmental influences on various human behavioral traits; to what extent do the same genetic and/or environmental influences impact the overlap between human behavioral traits; how do genetic and/or environmental influences on behavior change across development; and what environmental factors moderate the importance of genetic effects on human behavior (gene-environment interaction).  The field is interdisciplinary, and draws from genetics, psychology, and statistics.  Most recently, the field has moved into the area of statistical genetics, with many behavioral geneticists also involved in efforts to identify the specific genes involved in human behavior, and to understand how the effects associated with these genes changes across time, and in conjunction with the environment.\n\n7.

General principles of European Union law may be derived from common legal principles in the various EU member states, or general principles found in international law or European Union law.  Amongst others the European Court of Justice has recognised fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity as general principles of European Union law.

He was one of the most-wanted Mexican drug lords.\n\n1. John Clay Walker (October 5, 1948 - January 30, 1985) was an American journalist and aspiring novelist who was abducted, tortured and murdered in Mexico by members of the Guadalajara Cartel under orders of their leader Rafael Caro Quintero.  Caro Quintero suspected Walker of working as an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA) while he lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco.\n\n2. The Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez massacre occurred on the Mexican Federal Highway 40 on 13 May 2012.  Mexican officials stated that 49 people were decapitated and mutilated by members of Los Zetas drug cartel and dumped by a roadside near the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico.  The \"Blog del Narco\", a blog that documents events and people of the Mexican Drug War anonymously, reported that the actual (unofficial) death toll may be more than 68 people.  The bodies were found in the town of San Juan in the municipality of Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez, Nuevo Le\u00f3n at about 4\u00a0a.m. on a non-toll highway leading to Reynosa, Tamaulipas.  The forty-three men and six women killed had their heads, feet, and hands cut off, making their identification difficult.  Those killed also bore signs of torture and were stuffed in plastic bags.  The arrested suspects have indicated that the victims were Gulf Cartel members, but the Mexican authorities have not ruled out the possibility that they were U.S.-bound migrants.  Four days before this incident, 18 people were found decapitated and dismembered near Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara.\n\n3. The Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel (also known as the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization (BLO); Spanish: \"C\u00e1rtel de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva\" (\"CBL\")) was a Mexican drug cartel and organized crime syndicate, headed by the five Beltr\u00e1n Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto and H\u00e9ctor.

The cartel once was described as \"one of the biggest and most violent criminal groups in Mexico.\"  However, since the 2006 Sinaloa Cartel incursion in Baja California and the fall of the Arellano-F\u00e9lix brothers, the Tijuana Cartel had been reduced to few cells.  In 2016, the organization has become known as Cartel Tijuana Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (New Generation Tijuana Cartel) and has begun to aligin itself under the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, along with Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization (BLO) to create an anti-Sinaloa alliance, in which the Jalisco New Generation Cartel heads, creating a possible powershift in Mexico.\n\n6.

The Ju\u00e1rez Cartel has an armed wing known as La L\u00ednea, a Juarez street gang that usually performs the executions.  It also uses the Barrio Azteca gang to attack its enemies.\n\n9. The Medell\u00edn Cartel was a ruthless, highly organized and much-feared Colombian drug cartel originating in the city of Medell\u00edn, Colombia.

The Hatter is a fictional character in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and its sequel \"Through the Looking-Glass\".  He is often referred to as the Mad Hatter, though this term was never used by Carroll.  The phrase \"mad as a hatter\" pre-dates Carroll's works.  The Hatter and the March Hare are referred to as \"both \"mad\"\" by the Cheshire Cat, in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" in the seventh chapter titled \"A Mad Tea-Party\".\n\n7. To be as \"mad as a March hare\" is an English idiomatic phrase derived from the observed antics, said to occur only in the March breeding season of the European hare, \"Lepus europaeus\".

The March Hare is Atlantic Canada's largest poetry festival.  It started in 1987 or 1988 as an unpretentious evening of poetry and entertainment at the Blomidon Golf and Country Club in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, designed to appeal to a general audience.  The Hare takes place in early March each year.  Loosely associated with the Sir Wilfred Grenfell College campus of Memorial University through the leadership of poet-organizer Al Pittman and the involvement of other writers who taught at the College, the Hare was equally the brain-child of teacher Rex Brown and club manager George Daniels.  Although still anchored in Corner Brook, the event has evolved into a moveable feast of words and music that annually travels to St. John's and Gander, Newfoundland, Toronto, Ontario, and other venues, provincial, national and international.  In 2007, The March Hare visited seven centres in Ireland, including Dublin and Waterford.  In 2011, March Hares were mounted in Rocky Harbour, Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Charles Lutwidge Dodgson ( ; 27 January 1832 \u2013 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll ( ), was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon, and photographer.

Na Fianna \u00c9ireann (The Fianna of Ireland), known as the Fianna, is an Irish nationalist youth organisation founded by Bulmer Hobson and Constance Markievicz in 1909.  Fianna members were involved in the setting up of the armed nationalist body the Irish Volunteers, and had their own circle of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB).  They took part in the 1914 Howth gun-running and (as Volunteer members) in the 1916 Easter Rising.  They were active in the War of Independence and took the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War.\n\n1. Constance Georgine Markievicz, known as Countess Markievicz (Polish: \"Markiewicz\" ] ; n\u00e9e Gore-Booth; 4 February 1868 \u2013 15 July 1927) was an Irish Sinn F\u00e9in and Fianna F\u00e1il politician, revolutionary nationalist, suffragette and socialist.  A founder member of Fianna \u00c9ireann, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, she took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, when Irish republicans attempted to end British rule and establish an Irish Republic.  She was sentenced to death but this was reduced on the grounds of her gender.  In December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons, though she did not take her seat and, along with the other Sinn F\u00e9in TDs, formed the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  She was also the second woman in the world to hold a cabinet position (Minister for Labour of the Irish Republic, 1919\u20131922).\n\n2.

Liam Mac an Ultaigh of Dublin (fl.  c. 1965) is an Irish Nationalist and was Chief Scout of the Fianna \u00c9ireann from 1965.  In such tenure, Mac an Ultaigh is most recognized for his work on the Committee that under his administration drafted the Fianna Handbook\u2019s 3rd or 1965 (1st 1913, 2nd 1924) edition, which uniquely of the editions attempts to chronicle the organization\u2019s history.  Notably, this thorough and well documented Handbook history conclusively disputes traditional histories, which credit the Irish Republican Brotherhood\u2019s Bulmer Hobson with founding the \u201cScouts\u201d and exposes a, possible, anti-feminist bias in the traditional histories.  The 3rd Handbook in its section \u201cThe History and Tradition of the Fianna \u00c9ireann\u201d at its pages 24\u201326 credits instead the Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Constance Markievicz or \u201cthe Countess Markievicz\u201d with founding \u201cNa Fianna \u00c9ireann\u201d.  As already noted in the Wikipedia article Fianna \u00c9ireann, Patrick Pearse has stated that the creation of Fianna \u00c9ireann was historically as important to the liberation of Southern and Western Ireland from British rule and the founding of the Irish Free State and, later, the Republic of Ireland as was the creation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913.  The paramilitary Fianna \u00c9ireann youth Scouts were involved particularly with gun running commencing with the 1916 Easter Rising and later in combat, particularly in Dublin, during the Civil War period of 1922-1924.\n\n7.

He joined a junior-republican movement, Na Fianna Eireann, in 1937 and the following year, joined the Irish Republican Army.  In 1969, Cahill was a key figure in the founding of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.  During his time in the Provisional IRA, Cahill helped import weapons and raise financial support.  He served as the chief of staff in 1972, but was arrested the following year when a ship importing weapons was intercepted.  After his release, he continued to serve on the IRA Army Council and lead all financial dealings for Sinn F\u00e9in.  In the 1990s, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in began to work on seeking peace.  Cahill served on the council that called a cessation on 21 July 1996.  Cahill attended several of the talks that finally led to the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998.  Shortly after the agreement was made, Cahill resigned as treasurer of Sinn F\u00e9in.  To honour his service, he was made honorary Sinn F\u00e9in Vice-President for life.\n\n8. The Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931 (No. 37/1931) popularly called the Public Safety Act 1931, was an amendment to the Constitution of the Irish Free State which inserted Article 2A, empowering the Executive Council to declare a state of emergency during which most provisions of the constitution could be suspended and extra security measures taken.  These measures included the use of a military tribunal (the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal) to try civilians for political crimes, granting extra powers of search and arrest to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (police), and the prohibition of organisations deemed a threat to the state's security.  The act was rushed through in October by the then government, of Cumann na nGaedheal under W. T. Cosgrave, during a period of increased activity by physical force Irish republicans.  Cosgrave declared an emergency as soon as the act was passed and prohibited republican organisations, including the Irish Republican Army, Fianna Eireann, Cumann na mBan and Saor \u00c9ire, as well as communist revolutionary groups.  The military tribunal was motivated in part by jury intimidation in trials of republican activists.  The opposition Fianna F\u00e1il party condemned the act and ended the emergency when it gained power after the 1932 election.  However, in 1933 it reinstated the emergency and banned the Blueshirts, and in 1936 the IRA was banned again.  In the landmark 1934 case \"State (Ryan) v. Lennon\", the Supreme Court of Ireland held that the Oireachtas has not acted ultra vires in passing the 1931 act.\n\n9. The Federaci\u00f3n de Mocedades Galeguistas (FMG, \"Galicianist Youth Federation\" or \"Galician Nationalist Youth\" Federation in English language) was the youth organization of the Partido Galeguista, which was formed in January 1934, bringing together the different local nationalist youth organizations that had been formed since 1932.  It had around 1,000 members, its official organ was the Guieiro (\"Guide\" in English language), and their leaders were Xaime Illa Couto, Celso Emilio Ferreiro, Xos\u00e9 Velo and Ram\u00f3n Pi\u00f1eiro L\u00f3pez.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Constance Georgine Markievicz, known as Countess Markievicz (Polish: \"Markiewicz\" ] ; n\u00e9e Gore-Booth; 4 February 1868 \u2013 15 July 1927) was an Irish Sinn F\u00e9in and Fianna F\u00e1il politician, revolutionary nationalist, suffragette and socialist.

Rice excelled with his new team, catching 83 passes for 1,139 yards and 9 touchdowns.  None of the team's six regular-season losses and seven total losses were by more than a touchdown.  The Raiders would qualify for the postseason, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots in a divisional playoff game.  The loss was controversial; with a minute and 43 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and the Raiders winning 13-10, cornerback Charles Woodson appeared to force a fumble on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady that was recovered by the Raiders, but the play was ruled an incomplete pass.

The Raiders entered the season with a new quarterback in Terrelle Pryor.  Pryor started off the season in impressive fashion, with the team almost pulling off the upset in Week 1 against the Indianapolis Colts, and defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2.  The team and Pryor eventually cooled down, resulting in Pryor being benched for Matt McGloin in the game against the Houston Texans.  Before this game, history was made in the game against the Philadelphia Eagles when Eagles quarterback Nick Foles threw 7 touchdown passes, the most passing touchdowns the Raiders had ever allowed in its history.\n\n8. The 1980 Oakland Raiders season began with the team trying to improve on their 9\u20137 record from 1979.  It was the 20th anniversary of the Oakland Raiders franchise and ended with their second Super Bowl victory.  Prior to the start of the season Al Davis announced plans to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles.  However, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle blocked the move by filing a restraining order.  He would even try to get Al Davis removed as owner, as the case went to the courts.  Still playing in Oakland the Raiders entered the season with a new Quarterback after acquiring Dan Pastorini from the Houston Oilers for Kenny Stabler.  However Pastorini struggled and the Raiders got off to a 2-3 when Pastorini was injured and replaced by Jim Plunkett.  Plunkett proved right for the Raiders offense.  The defense led the league in interceptions (35), turnovers (52) and yards per carry (3.4 YPA).  Lester Hayes led the NFL with 13 interceptions.  The team won 6 straight compiling an 11-5 record, and qualifying for the playoffs as a Wild Card.  In the Wild Card Game the Raiders would beat the Houston Oilers 27-7 at Oakland as the Raiders defense picked off former teammate Kenny Stabler twice.  Playing in freezing weather with temperature reading 30 degrees below zero the Raiders stunned the Browns 14-12 in a defensive struggle in Cleveland.  In the AFC Championship Game in San Diego the game would be a shoot out as the Raiders stunned the Chargers 34-27 to become the first AFC Wild Card to make the Super Bowl.

Thomas Browne, 6th Baronet & 4th Viscount Kenmare (April 1726 \u2013 11 September 1795) was an Irish landowner and politician.  He was probably born at Killarney, County Kerry, the second of four children of Valentine Browne, fifth Baronet, third Viscount Kenmare (1695\u20131736), one of the few remaining great Roman Catholic landowners in Ireland, and his first wife, Honoria Butler (? -1730).  Thomas Browne's great-grandfather, Sir Valentine Browne, third Baronet, had been created first Viscount Kenmare by James II in March 1689.  This was an Irish peerage created after the removal of James II from the English throne, but during the period when James was de facto king of Ireland, before the conquest of Ireland by William III.  The first and second viscounts had fought for James II but seem never to have been formally attainted under William.  Consequently, the peerage remained on the Irish patent roll in a constitutionally ambiguous position, but was not formally recognised by the Protestant political establishment.\n\n5.

It was created a second time in 1665 for Folliott Wingfield.  He was the great-great-grandson of George Wingfield, uncle of the first Viscount of the 1618 creation.  However, the 1665 creation also became extinct on the death of its first holder in 1717.\n\n7. Baron Talbot is a title that has been created twice.

Transition scenarios are descriptions of future states which combine a future image with an account of the changes that would need to occur to reach that future.  These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal (backcasting).  Both these processes can use participatory techniques (Raskin et al., 2002) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions.\n\n9.

'Purple Prince' came 3rd overall in the public popularity poll conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society in its Buddleja trials at Wisley from 2008 to 2010.  \n\n5. Deep Purple are an English hard rock band from Hertford, Hertfordshire.  Originally known as Roundabout, the group formed in March 1968 featuring vocalist Rod Evans, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, bassist Nick Simper, drummer Ian Paice and keyboardist Jon Lord.  This first lineup of the band, known as Mark I, released three albums within the space of a year \u2013 \"Shades of Deep Purple\", \"The Book of Taliesyn\" and \"Deep Purple\" \u2013 before Evans and Simper were fired from the band at the request of Blackmore and Lord.  Mark II of Deep Purple saw Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replace Evans and Simper, respectively, in the summer of 1969.  This lineup of the band has since been identified as their most successful, with their next four albums reaching the top four of the UK Albums Chart, including number-one albums \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\".\n\n6. The Baum Bugle: A Journal of Oz is the official journal of The International Wizard of Oz Club.  The journal was founded in 1957, with its first issue released in June of that year (to a subscribers' list of sixteen).  It publishes three times per year, with issues dated Spring, Autumn, and Winter; Issue No. 1 of Volume 50 appeared in the Spring of 2006.  The journal publishes both scholarly and popular articles on L. Frank Baum, the Oz books written by Baum and other writers, and related subjects, plus reviews of Oz-related films and theater productions, rare photographs and illustrations, and similar materials.\n\n7.

Stephen Crain is the Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders (CCD), and a Distinguished Professor at Macquarie University in the Department of Linguistics.  He is a well-known researcher specializing in language acquisition, focusing specifically on syntax and semantics.  Crain views language acquisition as based on language-specific faculties, and he conducts his research in the tradition of Chomskyan generative grammar.  Recently, Crain has proposed that language is based on a universal logical system, and he has begun to explore the neural correlates of language acquisition from a cross-linguistic perspective using magnetoencephalography (MEG).  Crain received a BA in philosophy from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1971 and a PhD in cognitive science with an emphasis in linguistics from the University of California, Irvine in 1980.  Crain was employed as a Professor of Linguistics at the University of Connecticut from 1986 to 1995.  During that time he was also a Senior Scientist at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven Connecticut.  After leaving UConn, he took a position as Professor of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, College Park, from 1995 to 2003 before accepting a position as a Professor of Cognitive Science at Macquarie in 2004, where he has remained since.  He was Deputy Director of the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science from 2004 until 2010, and Director of the Centre for Language Sciences from 2007 until 2010.  He led the successful bid for an ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, which is funded from 2011 until 2017.\n\n1. Paul Thagard (born September 28, 1950) is a Canadian philosopher who specializes in philosophy, cognitive science, and the philosophy of science.  Thagard is currently a professor of Philosophy at the University of Waterloo, with cross appointment to Psychology and Computer Science.  He is the director of the Cognitive Science Program.  Thagard is a prolific writer, and has contributed to research in analogy and creativity, inference, cognition in the history of science, and the role of emotion in cognition.\n\n2. Dynamicism, also termed the \"dynamic hypothesis\" or the \"dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science\" or \"dynamic cognition\", is a new approach in cognitive science exemplified by the work of philosopher Tim van Gelder.  It argues that differential equations are more suited to modeling cognition than more traditional computer models.  Cf also dynamical systems theory.\n\n3. Distributed cognition is an approach to cognitive science research that deploys models of the extended mind (see, for example, the paper \"The Extended Mind\") by taking as the fundamental unit of analysis \"a collection of individuals and artifacts and their relations to each other in a particular work practice\" .  \"DCog\" is a specific approach to distributed cognition (distinct from other meanings) which takes a computational perspective towards goal-based activity systems.  Dcog frameworks employed were originally developed in the mid-1980s by Edwin Hutchins, who continues to be the leading pioneer and whose research is based at the University of California at San Diego.\n\n4. Cognitive ecology is the study of cognitive phenomena within social and natural contexts.  It is an integrative perspective drawing from aspects of ecological psychology, cognitive science, evolutionary ecology and anthropology.  Notions of domain-specific modules in the brain and the cognitive biases they create are central to understanding the enacted nature of cognition within a cognitive ecological framework.  This means that cognitive mechanisms not only shape the characteristics of thought, but they dictate the success of culturally transmitted ideas.  Because culturally transmitted concepts can often inform ecological decision-making behaviors, group-level trends in cognition (i.e., culturally salient concepts) are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.\n\n5. Distributed language represents an externalist perspective on human cognition.  Instead of tracing communication to individual knowledge of a symbolic system, language-activity is taken to sustain the human world.  Extending work by Humberto Maturana, priority is given to how face-to-face interaction draws on multimodal activity or languaging . [1] As people language together, they gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in a range of activities in which wordings play a part.  Over time, these activities construct and maintain language as a whole.  Distributed language thus links a biological theory of the origin of language to distributed cognition.  Human cognitive and communicative abilities arise as people do things together while drawing on material, linguistic and other resources.  Language activity is constrained by biology, circumstances, and collective ways of life.  While bodies sustain coordination, our lived realities are extended by the resources of a partly shared collective world.  Thus, language cannot be separated from the artifacts and institutions or the behaviour of the living beings who undertake collaborative (and solo) tasks.  This distributed perspective challenges the mainstream view that language use can be explained by individual competencies and microsocial rules.  To ascribe 'language' to individual organisms is, on the distributed perspective, an error.  Building on cognitive science, the perspective challenges cognitive internalism by presenting language as a prime case of embodied and culturally embedded cognition.  It emphasizes that the heterogeneity of human language does much to shape people, mind and society.\n\n6. Bayesian Cognitive Science (also known as Computational Cognitive Science) is a rapidly growing approach to cognitive science concerned with the rational analysis of cognition through the use of Bayesian inference and cognitive modeling.  The term \"computational\" refers to the computational level of analysis as put forth by David Marr.\n\n7. The paper The Extended Mind by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) is a seminal work in the field of extended cognition.  In this paper, Clark and Chalmers present the idea of \"active externalism\" (similar to semantic or \"content\" externalism), in which objects within the environment function as a part of the mind.  They argue that it is arbitrary to say that the mind is contained only within the boundaries of the skull.  The separation between the mind, the body, and the environment is seen as an unprincipled distinction.  Because external objects play a significant role in aiding cognitive processes, the mind and the environment act as a \"coupled system\".  This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own.  In this manner, the mind is extended into the external world.  The main criterion that Clark and Chalmers list for classifying the use of external objects during cognitive tasks as a part of an extended cognitive system is that the external objects must function with the same purpose as the internal processes.\n\n8. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.  It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition.  Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information.  Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology.  The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization.  The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\"\n\n9. Embodied embedded cognition (EEC) is a philosophical theoretical position in cognitive science, closely related to situated cognition, embodied cognition, embodied cognitive science and dynamical systems theory.  The theory states that intelligent behaviour emerges from the interplay between brain, body and world.  The world is not just the 'play-ground' on which the brain is acting.  Rather, brain, body and world are equally important factors in the explanation of how particular intelligent behaviours come about in practice.  There are concerns about whether EEC constitutes a novel and substantive approach to cognition or whether it is merely a manifestation of frustration with the classical cognitivist approach.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The paper The Extended Mind by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) is a seminal work in the field of extended cognition.

Polk began on March 4, 1845, when he was inaugurated as the 11th President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1849.  James K. Polk, a Democrat, assumed office after defeating Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election.  Polk left office after one term, fulfilling a campaign pledge he made in 1844, and he was succeeded by Whig Zachary Taylor.  A close ally of Andrew Jackson, Polk's presidency reflected his adherence to the ideals of Jacksonian democracy and manifest destiny.\n\n1. The inauguration of James K. Polk as the 11th President of the United States took place on Tuesday, March 4, 1845, a rainy day with morning thunderstorms.  The inauguration marked the commencement of the only four-year term of James K. Polk as President and George M. Dallas as Vice President.  Polk was sworn in at the East Portico of the United States Capitol by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney.  This was the first inaugural ceremony to be reported by telegraph and to be shown in a newspaper illustration (in \"The Illustrated London News\").\n\n2.

Polk Place was the home of 11th President of the United States James K. Polk and his wife Sarah Childress Polk on Vine Street in Nashville, Tennessee, which he purchased from his mentor Felix Grundy.  It was called \"Grundy Place\" and was changed to \"Polk Place.\"  It was his final residence and where he died in 1849 at age 53.  After his death his wife continued to reside there.  During the Civil War, Polk Place was considered neutral ground by both the Confederate and Union armies.  In spite of the fact that she had nephews fighting on the Confederate side, Union Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell frequently paid their respects to the former first lady.  After a short illness, Mrs. Polk died at Polk Place in 1891, just short of her 88th birthday.  James K. Polk's tomb was located on the front lawn until 1893, when it was moved to the Tennessee State Capitol.  What followed was a long legal dispute centered on James K. Polk's will, after which the heirs of President and Mrs. Polk sold Polk Place.  The state of Tennessee nearly acquired Polk Place and made it the governor's mansion (at the time, the governor of Tennessee stayed in a hotel room).  A developer bought the house and had it demolished in 1900 to build a small apartment building.  The YWCA bought the property in 1909 and built a new state-of-the-art facility.

When the Senate passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill 34 to 16 on July 24, 1846, opponents lobbied for a presidential veto.  It was vetoed by President James K. Polk on August 3.  The bill would have provided for federally funded internal improvements on small harbors, many of them on the Great Lakes.  Polk believed that this was unconstitutional because the bill unfairly favored particular areas, including that which had no foreign trade.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Oregon Treaty is a treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States that was signed on June 15, 1846, in Washington, D.C.

It is sometimes called stocking or privatization.  As part of the demutualization process, members of a mutual usually receive a \"windfall\" payout, in the form of shares in the successor company, a cash payment, or a mixture of both.  Mutualization or mutualisation is the opposite process, wherein a shareholder-owned company is converted into a mutual organization, typically through takeover by an existing mutual organization.  Furthermore, re-mutualization depicts the process of aligning or refreshing the interest and objectives of the members of the mutual society.\n\n8.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the Kingdom of France.  The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.\n\n2. The Unidad de Operaciones Especiales (\"Special Operations Unit\" - UOE) was the elite special operations force of the Spanish Navy and Marines from 1967 to 2009.  In June 2009, the unit was absorbed into the newly formed Naval Special Warfare Force (\"Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial\").  The UOE, which was formerly garrisoned in the \"Tercio de Armada\" in San Fernando, C\u00e1diz, operated under the direct control of the Admiralty and Naval Special Warfare Command.  It was thought to comprise approximately 100 men organized into three Operational Teams (\"Estoles\") as well as command and support personnel.\n\n3. The Sussex Pledge was a promise made by Germany to the United States in 1916, during World War 1 before the latter entered the war.  Early in 1915, Germany had instituted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, allowing armed merchant ships, but not passenger ships, to be torpedoed without warning.  Despite this avowed restriction, a French cross-channel passenger ferry, the \"Sussex\" , was torpedoed without warning on March 24, 1916; the ship was severely damaged and about 49\u00a01/2 people died.  Although no US citizens were killed in this attack, it prompted President Woodrow Wilson to declare that if Germany were to continue this practice, the United States would break diplomatic relations with Germany.  Fearing the entry of the United States into the war, Germany tried to appease the United States by issuing, on May 4, 1916, the Sussex pledge, which promised a change in Germany's naval warfare policy.  These were the primary elements of the pledge:\n\n4. A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare.  Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state.  As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships.  Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew.  Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.\n\n5. Mars, also known as Makal\u00f6s (\"peerless; astounding\") was a Swedish warship that was built between 1563 and 1564.  It was the leading ship of king Eric XIV of Sweden's fleet, and at 48 meters and, equipped with 107 guns, was one of the largest warships of the time, even larger than the famous Swedish ship \"Vasa\".  In 1564, during the Northern Seven Years' War, the ship caught fire and exploded during the first battle of \u00d6land in the Baltic Sea.  \"Mars\" has a place in the history of naval warfare for being the first ship to sink another ship with gunfire.\n\n6. In sailing naval warfare, raking fire is fire directed parallel to the long axis of an enemy ship from ahead or astern.  Although each shot is directed against a smaller target profile than by shooting broadside and thus more likely to miss the target ship to one side or the other, an individual cannon shot that hits will pass through more of the ship, thereby increasing damage to the hull, sails, cannon and crew.  In addition, the targeted ship will have fewer (if any) guns able to return fire.  A stern rake tends to be more damaging than a bow rake because the shots are not deflected by the curved (and strengthened) bow, and because disabling the exposed rudder at the stern would render the target unable to steer and thus manoeuvre.  However, achieving a position to rake a single enemy ship was usually very difficult unless the opponent was unable to manoeuvre due to damage to the sails or rudder; it was easier if a ship was constrained by its position in the line of battle.\n\n7. Her Majesty's Naval Service, also known as the Senior Service, is the United Kingdom's naval warfare and maritime service.  It consists of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines Reserve and Naval Careers Service.  The term Naval Service should be distinguished from the \"UK Naval Services\", which consist of the Naval Service and the Merchant Navy.  The Naval Service as a whole falls under the command of the Navy Board, which is headed by the First Sea Lord.  This position is currently held by Admiral Sir Phillip Jones (appointed April 2016).

Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state.  As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships.

Inquiry education (sometimes known as the inquiry method) is a student-centered method of education focused on asking questions.  Students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid giving answers when this is possible, and in any case to avoid giving direct answers in favor of asking more questions.  The method was advocated by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner in their book \"Teaching as a Subversive Activity\".\n\n1. Charles Samuel Peskin (born April 15, 1946) is an American mathematician known for his work in the mathematical modeling of blood flow in the heart.  Such calculations are useful in the design of artificial heart valves.  From this work has emerged an original computational method for fluid-structure interaction that is now called the \u201cimmersed boundary method\".  The immersed boundary method allows the coupling between deformable immersed structures and fluid flows to be handled in a computationally tractable way.  With his students and colleagues, Peskin also has worked on mathematical models of such systems as the inner ear, arterial pulse, blood clotting, congenital heart disease, light adaptation in the retina, control of ovulation number, control of plasmid replication, molecular dynamics, and molecular motors.\n\n2. Association mapping (genetics), also known as \"linkage disequilibrium mapping\", is a method of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that takes advantage of historic linkage disequilibrium to link phenotypes (observable characteristics) to genotypes (the genetic constitution of organisms), uncovering genetic associations.\n\n3. Joan Feynman (born March 31, 1927) is an American astrophysicist.  She has made important contributions to the study of solar wind particles and fields; sun-Earth relations; and magnetospheric physics.  In particular, Feynman is known for developing an understanding of the origin of auroras.  She is also known for creating a model that predicts the number of high-energy particles likely to hit a spacecraft over its lifetime, and for uncovering a method for predicting sunspot cycles.  Feynman is the younger sister of physicist Richard Feynman.\n\n4. The runoff curve number (also called a curve number or simply CN) is an empirical parameter used in hydrology for predicting direct runoff or infiltration from rainfall excess.  The curve number method was developed by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, which was formerly called the \"Soil Conservation Service\" or \"SCS\" \u2014 the number is still popularly known as a \"SCS runoff curve number\" in the literature.  The runoff curve number was developed from an empirical analysis of runoff from small catchments and hillslope plots monitored by the USDA.  It is widely used and is an efficient method for determining the approximate amount of direct runoff from a rainfall event in a particular area.\n\n5.

His articles and columns have appeared in \"Time\", \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Life\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", the \"Washington Post\", \"Men's Health\" and other publications.  As of 2002, he was an editor of \"Popular Science\".  His mother is the astrophysicist Joan Feynman and his uncle was Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.\n\n6. The dead-end elimination algorithm (DEE) is a method for minimizing a function over a discrete set of independent variables.  The basic idea is to identify \"dead ends\", i.e., combinations of variables that are not necessary to define a global minimum because there is always a way of replacing such combination by a better or equivalent one.  Then we can refrain from searching such combinations further.  Hence, dead-end elimination is a mirror image of dynamic programming, in which \"good\" combinations are identified and explored further.  Although the method itself is general, it has been developed and applied mainly to the problems of predicting and designing the structures of proteins.  It closely related to the notion of dominance in optimization also known as substitutability in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem.

He was known, especially in Ireland, for predicting the downfall of Protestantism in 1821\u20135 and the triumphant emergence of the Catholic Church.\n\n9. Dodgson's method is an electoral system proposed by the author, mathematician and logician Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll.  The method is to extend the Condorcet method by swapping candidates until a Condorcet winner is found.  The winner is the candidate which requires the minimum number of swaps.  Dodgson proposed this voting scheme in his 1876 work \"A method of taking votes on more than two issues\".  Given an integer \"k\" and an election, it is NP-complete to determine whether a candidate can become a Condorcet winner with fewer than \"k\" swaps.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Joan Feynman (born March 31, 1927) is an American astrophysicist.

Giovanni Guicciardi (12 January 1819 \u2013 4 October 1883) was an Italian opera singer who sang leading baritone roles in the opera houses of Italy and Portugal.  He is most remembered today for having created the role of Count di Luna in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", although he created several other leading roles in operas by lesser known Italian composers.  He accumulated a considerable fortune during the course of his career.  After his retirement from the stage, he taught without payment in music schools in his native city, Reggio Emilia, and presided over a charity for orphaned musicians.  He died in San Polo d'Enza at the age of 64.\n\n1. Corrado Zambelli (3 June 1897 - 1 September 1974) was an Italian classical bass who had an active international singing career in operas and concerts from the 1920s through the 1950s.  He appears on several complete opera recordings, including \"Otello\" and \"Carmen\" for His Master's Voice; and \"Ernani\", \"Il trovatore\", \"La favorite\", and \"La Gioconda\" for Columbia Records.\n\n2. This is a partial discography of Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Il trovatore\" (\"The Troubadour\") and \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" (the revised version in French translation).  At least 83 recordings exist of the opera as a whole, made between 1912 and 2011, although not all of them are absolutely complete.  Of these, 45 are live audio recordings, 22 are studio audio recordings, and 16 are videos or movies.  \"Il trovatore\" was first performed at the Teatro Apollo, Rome on 19 January 1853.  \"Le trouv\u00e8re\" was first presented on 12 January 1857.\n\n3. Gaetano Fraschini (16 February 1816 \u2013 23 May 1887) was an Italian tenor.  He created many roles in 19th century operas, including five composed by Giuseppe Verdi.  His voice was \"heroic ... with a baritonal quality, ... yet Verdi and Donizetti appreciated his ability to sing softly and with subtlety.\"  An Italian biographer has pointed out Fraschini's role in extending the longevity of Donizetti's operas, while at the same time accelerating the ascent of Verdi's repertory.  He was indeed the most prominent singer who facilitated the transition from Donizetti to Verdi.  Fraschini sang over one hundred roles and Verdi placed him at the top of his favorite tenors' list and described him as a \"natural Manrico\" for his \"Il trovatore\".  Fraschini also played a pivotal role in the success of many operas by Pacini and Mercadante.\n\n4. Alcina (HWV 34) is an opera seria by George Frideric Handel.  Handel used the libretto of \"L'isola di Alcina\", an opera that was set in 1728 in Rome by Riccardo Broschi, which he acquired the year after during his travels in Italy.  Partly altered for better conformity, the story was originally taken from Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\" (like those of the Handel operas \"Orlando\" and \"Ariodante\"), an epic poem.  The opera contains several musical sequences with opportunity for dance: these were composed for dancer Marie Sall\u00e9.\n\n5. Il trovatore (] ; Italian for \"The Troubadour\") is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the play \"El trovador\" (1836) by Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez.  It was Guti\u00e9rrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\"\n\n6. Vincenzo Moscuzza (1827\u20131896) was an Italian composer.  Born in Syracuse, Sicily, he was the son of composer Luigi Moscuzza, and his initial musical training was from his father.  He later studied at the Naples Conservatory with Saverio Mercadante.  He is chiefly known for his many operas, of which his most successful were \"Stradella il trovatore\" (1850), \"Don Carlo\" (1862), and \"Gonzales Davila\" (1869).  He died in Naples.\n\n7. Frank Guarrera (December 3, 1923 \u2013 November 23, 2007) was an Italian-American lyric baritone who enjoyed a long and distinguished career at the Metropolitan Opera, singing with the company for a total of 680 performances.  He performed 35 different roles at the Met, mostly from the Italian and French repertories, from 1948 through 1976.  His most frequent assignments at the house were as Escamillo in Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\", Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's \"La Boh\u00e8me\", Valentin in Charles Gounod's \"Faust\", and Ping in Puccini's \"Turandot\".  He was also an admired interpreter of Mozart roles, establishing himself in the parts of both Guglielmo and Don Alfonso in \"Cos\u00ec fan tutte\" and Count Almaviva in \"Le nozze di Figaro\".  Most of the roles he portrayed were from the lyric repertoire, such as the title role in Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\", but he also sang some heavier roles at the Met like Amonasro in \"A\u00efda\", Jack Rance in \"La fanciulla del West\" and Il conte di Luna in \"Il trovatore\".\n\n8. Ferrucio Calusio (1889 or 1890 - 3 June 1983) was an Argentine conductor.  He began his career in the 1920s at La Scala in Milan, Italy as an assistant conductor to Arturo Toscanini.  In 1927 he returned to his native country to join the conducting staff of the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires.  He served as one of that house's main conductors in the Italian repertoire through 1960.  He also worked as a guest conductor with several important opera houses during his career, including conducting several operas at La Scala in the 1930s and at the Metropolitan Opera (\"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Il trovatore\") in 1940-1941.  In 1939 he conducted the orchestra of La Scala for the first recording of Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\".  He died in Buenos Aires at the age of 93.\n\n9. Rolando Panerai (born 17 October 1924) is an Italian baritone, particularly associated with the Italian repertory.  He was born in Campi Bisenzio, near Florence, Italy and studied with Frazzi in Florence and Armani and Giulia Tess in Milan.  Panerai made his stage debut in 1947 in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo as the pharaon in Rossini's \"Mos\u00e8 in Egitto\".  Other debuts, both in 1951, were as Simon Boccanegra in \"Simon Boccanegra\" in Bergamo and as Sharpless in \"Madama Butterfly\" at La Scala in Milan.  He sang in many rarely performed Verdi operas on radio broadcast for RAI in 1951 (to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Verdi's death), such as \"Giovanna d'Arco\", \"La battaglia di Legnano\", and \"Aroldo\".  Later roles included most of the great Verdi baritone roles, particularly the title character in \"Rigoletto\", The Count of Luna in \"Il trovatore\", Giorgio Germont in \"La traviata\", Marquis of Posa in \"Don Carlos\", Amonasro in \"Aida\".\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Alcina (HWV 34) is an opera seria by George Frideric Handel.

Labor Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes had, by 1916, become an enthusiastic supporter of conscription as a means to boost Australia's contribution to the war effort.  On 30 August 1916, he announced plans for a referendum on the issue (the Australian plebiscite, 1916), and introduced enabling legislation into parliament on 14 September, which passed only with the support of the opposition.  Six of Hughes' ministers resigned in protest at the move, and the New South Wales state branch of the Labor Party expelled Hughes.  The referendum saw an intense campaign in which Labor figures vehemently advocated on each side of the argument, although the \"no\" campaign narrowly won on 14 November.  In the wake of the referendum defeat, the caucus moved to expel Hughes on 14 November; instead, he and 23 supporters resigned and formed the National Labor Party.  Frank Tudor was elected leader of the rump party.  Hughes was recommissioned as Prime Minister, heading a minority government supported by the opposition Commonwealth Liberal Party; the two parties then merged as the Nationalist Party of Australia and won the 1917 federal election.  The Nationalist Party served as the main conservative party of Australia until 1931, and the split resulted in many early Labor figures ending their careers on the political right.\n\n6.

After an unsuccessful candidacy as a United Labor Party (ULP) member in 1899, he was elected as an \"independent liberal\" in a by-election in 1900.  He was re-elected in 1902, but defeated in 1905.  The following year, he was elected as a ULP candidate, and retained his seat for that party (the Australian Labor Party from 1917) until 1931.  Along with the rest of the cabinet, he was ejected from the Australian Labor Party in 1931, and was a member of the Parliamentary Labor Party until his electoral defeat at the hands of a Lang Labor Party candidate in 1933.\n\n7.

Ford had already adapted the film once before in 1919 as \"Marked Men.\"  The original silent adaptation by Ford is thought to be lost today.  The story is something of a retelling of the story of The Three Wise Men in an American Western context.  Ford decided to remake the story in Technicolor and dedicate the film to the memory of long-time friend Harry Carey, who starred in the 1919 film \"Marked Men\".

Herod, following a verse from the Book of Micah interpreted as a prophecy, directs them to Bethlehem, to the south of Jerusalem.  The star leads them to Jesus' home in the town, where they worship him and give him gifts.  The wise men are then given a divine warning not to return to Herod so they return home by a different route.\n\n8.

All that is known of him is that at the suggestion of Solomon ha-Kohen, a pupil of Maimonides, he wrote to the latter asking his advice in regard to a pseudo-Messiah who was leading the Jews of southern Arabia astray.  From a passage in Maimonides' \"Letter to the Wise Men of the Congregation of Marseilles\", the date of Jacob's letter is fixed as 1172 (Halub, in his ed.  of \"Iggeret Teman,\" p.\u00a051, note).  In answer, Maimonides sent his \"Iggeret Teman\" or, as it is also called, \"Petah Tikva.\"  Abraham Harkavy supposes that Jacob had knowledge of Saadia Gaon's \"Sefer ha-Galui\" (\"Studien und Mittheil.\"  v.154; comp.  \"Monatsschrift,\" xliv.508).

The following is a list of journals in the field of psychiatry.  Psychiatry journals generally publish articles with either a general focus (meaning all aspects of psychiatry are included) or with a more specific focus.  This list includes notable psychiatry articles sorted by name and focus within psychiatry.\n\n1. Canadian Journal of Family Law is the first interdisciplinary academic journal in Canada to publish articles on a wide variety of family law issues.  It is national in its scope, publishing articles in both English and French on topics in either common law or civil law.  The \"Journal\" also publishes papers originally presented at regional conferences on family law.\n\n2. Prescrire also known as La Revue Prescrire is a monthly medical journal in French which addresses developments in diseases, medications, and in medical techniques and technologies.  \"Prescrire\" contains no advertising, and is internally financed by subscriptions and the sale of various personnel training.

In academic publishing, a scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research.  Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists.  There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals).  Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as \"Nature\" publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.  Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity.  Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different.  Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine.  The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method.  If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results.  Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.\n\n4. This is a list of scientific journals that publish articles in pharmaceutical sciences.\n\n5.

Ellis Farmhouse is an historic residence located north of Bussey, Iowa, United States.  Evan, his wife Bertha, and their two daughters moved from Illinois and settled on the 120 acre farm they bought in Marion County, Iowa in 1909.  He built this Sears, Roebuck & Co. \"Honor Bilt Modern Homes\" pre-cut house in 1913.  It was unusual for such a house to be built in a rural area because all the parts would have to be transported a longer distance.  The two-story frame house features a full-length front porch, projecting wall dormers, and it is capped with a hipped roof.  After Evan's (1949) and Bertha's (1959) deaths, their daughter Mary continued to live in the house and run the farm until her death in 1974.  While the family continued to own the farm, the house was rented to tenants until 1983 when Bonnie Vanderlinden Noah, Evan and Bertha's granddaughter, and her husband Jack began restoring the house for them to live in.

The rook and bishop versus rook endgame is a chess endgame where one player has just a rook, bishop and king, and the other player has only a rook and king.

It is generally a theoretical draw, but the rook and bishop have good winning chances in practice because the defense is difficult.  Ulf Andersson won the position twice within a year, once against a grandmaster and once against a candidate grandmaster; and grandmaster Keith Arkell has won it 18 times out of 18 .  In positions that have a forced win, up to 59 moves are required .  Tony Kosten has seen the endgame many times in master games, with the stronger side almost always winning .

Crosswind kite power is power derived from a class of airborne wind-energy conversion systems (AWECS, aka AWES) or crosswind kite power systems (CWKPS) characterized by a kite system that has energy-harvesting parts that fly transverse to the direction of the ambient wind, i.e., to crosswind mode; sometimes the entire wing set and tether set is flown in crosswind mode.  These systems at many scales from toy to power-grid-feeding sizes may be used as high-altitude wind power (HAWP) devices or low-altitude wind power (LAWP) devices without having to use towers.  Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system.  A tethered wing, flying in crosswind at many times wind speed, harvests wind power from an area that is many times exceeding the wing\u2019s own area.  Crosswind kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines: access to more powerful and stable wind resource, high capacity factor, capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs, and no need for a tower.  Additionally, the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency; the movement of crosswinding tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades.  However, a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to crosswind and is a form of crosswind kite power.  Miles L. Loyd furthered studies on crosswind kite power systems in his work \"Crosswind Kite Power\" in 1980.  Some believe that crosswind kite power was introduced by P. Payne and C. McCutchen in their patent No. 3,987,987, filed in 1975, however, crosswind kite power was used far before such patent, e.g., in target kites for war-target practice where the crosswinding power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners.\n\n5. The inverse gambler's fallacy, named by philosopher Ian Hacking, is a formal fallacy of Bayesian inference which is an inverse of the better known gambler's fallacy.  It is the fallacy of concluding, on the basis of an unlikely outcome of a random process, that the process is likely to have occurred many times before.  For example, if one observes a pair of fair dice being rolled and turning up double sixes, it is wrong to suppose that this lends any support to the hypothesis that the dice have been rolled many times before.  We can see this from the Bayesian update rule: letting \"U\" denote the unlikely outcome of the random process and \"M\" the proposition that the process has occurred many times before, we have\n\n6.

Various and currently outdated theories have been proposed that postulate waves of migration during the Middle Bronze Age in the Ancient Near East.  While the turmoils that separate the Late Bronze Age from the Early Iron Age are well documented (see Bronze Age collapse), theories of migration during the Middle Bronze Age (20th century BCE) have little direct support.\n\n1. The Bronze and Iron Age cultures in Poland are known mainly from archeological research.  Early Bronze Age cultures in Poland begun around 2300\u20132400 BCE, while the Iron Age commenced in approximately 700\u2013750 BCE.  The Iron Age archeological cultures no longer existed by the start of the Common Era.  The subject of the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of the groups living in central and eastern Europe at that time is, given the absence of written records, speculative, and accordingly there is considerable disagreement.  In Poland the Lusatian culture, spanning both the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent.  The most famous archeological finding from that period is the Biskupin fortified settlement (gord) on the lake from which it takes its name, representing the Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age.\n\n2. The Nordic Bronze Age (also Northern Bronze Age, or Scandinavian Bronze Age) is a period of Scandinavian prehistory from c. 1700\u2013500 BC.  The Bronze Age culture of this era succeeded the Nordic Stone Age culture (Late Neolithic) and was followed by the Pre-Roman Iron Age.  The archaeological legacy of the Nordic Bronze Age culture is rich, but the ethnic and linguistic affinities of it are unknown, in the absence of written sources.  Some scholars also include sites in what is now Estonia, northern Germany and Pomerania, as part of its cultural sphere.\n\n3. The Late Bronze Age collapse was a Dark Age transition period in the Near East, Aegean Region, North Africa, Caucasus, Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, a transition historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive.  The palace economy of the Aegean Region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages.\n\n4. The Danes started with a system of units based on a Greek \"pous\" (\"foot\") of 308.4 mm which they picked up through trade in the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age.  Some early standards of measure can be recovered from measured drawings made of the 52.5 ft Hjortspring boat, which though dating to the early Iron Age exemplifies plank-built vessels of the late Bronze Age and the 82 ft Nydam ship.  Thwarts are typically spaced about 3 \"fod\" apart.\n\n5. Located in a lush agricultural section of southern littoral of Lebanon, Tell el-Burak has been under investigation by the American University of Beirut and the University of T\u00fcbingen since 1998.  The excavations have revealed three occupations on the tell, the latest in the Ottoman Period, the next in the Iron Age, and the earliest in the Middle Bronze Age.  During this earliest stage the mound was built as part of a defensive structure serving as the base for a fortress on its top.  In the Iron Age, Tell el-Burak was home to a settlement that was prosperous and peaceful, as seen in its defenseless and fine architecture.  There is no apparent occupation in the intervening Late Bronze Age as the site was seemingly abandoned in favor of Sarepta, four kilometers to the south.\n\n6. The 10th century BC started the first day of 1000 BC and ended the last day of 901 BC.  This period followed the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Near East, and the century saw the Early Iron Age take hold there.  The Greek Dark Ages which had come about in 1200 BC continued.  The Neo-Assyrian Empire is established towards the end of the 10th century BC.  In the Iron Age in India, the Vedic period is ongoing.  In China, the Zhou dynasty is in power.  Bronze Age Europe continued with Urnfield culture.  Japan was inhabited by an evolving hunter-gatherer society during the J\u014dmon period.\n\n7. The Levant is a geographical term that refers to a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east.  It stretches 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert, and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert.  The term is also sometimes used to refer to modern events or states in the region immediately bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea: Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria.\n\n8. Edom ( or ; ; Assyrian: \"Udumi\"; Syriac: \u0710\u0715\u0718\u0721) was a country in Transjordan, between Ammon to the north, the Dead Sea and the Arabah to the west, and the Arabian desert to the south and east. .  Most of its former territory is now divided between Israel and Jordan.  Edom appears in written sources relating to the late Bronze Age and to the Iron Age in the Levant, such as the Hebrew Bible and Egyptian and Mesopotamian records.  In classical antiquity, the cognate name Idumea was used for a smaller area in the same general region.\n\n9. The Tartessian language is the extinct Paleohispanic language of inscriptions in the Southwestern script found in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula: mainly in the south of Portugal (Algarve and southern Alentejo), and the southwest of Spain (south of Extremadura and western Andalusia).  There are 95 of these inscriptions, the longest having 82 readable signs.  Around one-third of them were found in Early Iron Age necropolises or other Iron Age burial sites associated with rich complex burials.  It is usual to date them to the 7th century BC and consider the southwestern script to be the most ancient Paleohispanic script, with characters most closely resembling specific Phoenician letter forms found in inscriptions dated to \"c.\" 825 BC.  Five of the inscriptions occur on \"stelae\" with what has been interpreted as Late Bronze Age carved warrior gear from the Urnfield culture.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Levant is a geographical term that refers to a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east.

At the time, however, Little was a scriptwriter for \"Coronation Street\"' s rival, \"EastEnders\", broadcast on BBC One.  Though \"Coronation Street\" is, and always has been, broadcast on ITV, a competing network, the idea of documenting the show on the anniversary of its half century running was picked up by its natural rival, the BBC.  It has, however, been repeated several times on ITV3 and, on the occasion of Tony Warren's death, ITV.\n\n3. Sian Powers is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", portrayed by Sacha Parkinson.

Weatherfield is a fictional town based on Salford, Lancashire, which is the setfting for the British ITV soap opera \"Coronation Street\".  Much of Weatherfield has been seen by viewers throughout the years, though the primary focus from the viewer's perspective is the Coronation Street, a cobbled street where many of the programme's characters live.  Weatherfield areas are often shot on location around Manchester, as its filming studios, the Granada Studios complex on Quay Street in Manchester city centre (closed 2013) and its new set MediaCityUK in Salford Quays (opened 2014), only house the outdoor sets of Coronation Street and its immediate surrounding streets.\n\n8.

Michie is from Scotland, but because \"Coronation Street\" is set in Manchester, he uses a Mancunian accent for the role.  Karl was introduced along with his girlfriend, Stella Price (Michelle Collins) and her daughter, Eva (Catherine Tyldesley).  Karl made his first appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 June 2011.  On 30 April 2013, it was announced that Michie would be leaving \"Coronation Street\".  Karl departed during the episode broadcast on 13 September 2013.\n\n9.

In doubles, she finished the year ranked world no. 3, despite playing only six tournaments as a pair.  She won five Grand Slam titles, putting her total Grand Slam titles at 23.\n\n1. The Grand Slam tournaments, also called majors, are the four most important annual tennis events.  They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of \"best of\" sets for men.  The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, the French Open in May and June, Wimbledon in July, and the US Open in August and September.  Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks.  The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass.  Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905.  However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924\u201325, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments.  Skipping Grand Slam tournaments\u2014especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money\u2014was not unusual before 1982, which was the start of the norm of counting Grand Slam titles.\n\n2.

He also trailed Nadal 3\u20131 in the final set but won 5 games in a row to win the title.  This ended a 6-match losing streak against Nadal in Grand Slam events.  Having lost all of their previous three encounters, this was the first time Federer defeated Nadal at the Australian Open and also marked Federer's first Grand Slam victory over Nadal outside the grass courts of Wimbledon.

He had a renowned backhand and enjoyed a long career at the highest levels from the early 1950s to the early 1970s.  Rosewall was one of the two best male players for about nine years and was the World No. 1 player for a number of years in the early 1960s.  He was ranked among the top 20 players, amateur or professional, every year from 1952 through 1977.  Rosewall is the only player to have simultaneously held Pro Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (1962\u20131963).

There is a noted professional rivalry between them \u2013 between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.

The 1973 Old Bailey bombing was a car bomb attack carried out by the Provisional IRA (PIRA) which took place outside the Old Bailey Courthouse on 8 March 1973.  The attack was carried out by a 10-person ASU from the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade.  The unit also exploded a second bomb which went off outside the Ministry of Agriculture in London on the same day at around the same time the bomb at the Old Bailey bomb went off.  This was the Provisional IRA's first major attack on mainland Britain since The Troubles began back in 1969.  One British civilian died of a heart attack attributed to the bombing, estimates of the injured range from 180 - 220.  Two additional bombs were found and defused.  Nine people from Belfast were convicted six months later for the bombing, and one acquitted for providing information to the police.\n\n1. Mohammad Daleel (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0644), known as Abu Yusuf al-Karrar (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0631), was a Syrian man who fought for a number of rebel groups during the Syrian Civil War, including the Islamic State.  On 24 July 2016, he carried out the 2016 Ansbach bombing, killing himself and wounding fifteen people.  The attack, carried out in retaliation for Germany's role in the Military intervention against ISIL, was the first suicide bombing carried out in Germany.  German authorities now believe Daleel intended to remotely detonate the Ansbach bomb while filming it and to later commit further terrorist attacks.\n\n2. 2004 Jalna Mosque bomb attack refers to two separate crude bomb attacks at local mosques in Jalna, Maharashtra on 27 August 2004.  According to senior police officer, the first blast occurred at Kadriya Masjid in Jalna at 1:45 pm and the second explosion occurred barely 15 minutes later at another mosque on the outskirts of Poorna town in Parbhani district.  The attacks were carried out during Friday prayer and total 18 people were injured.  Alleged preceptors were Maroti Keshwarao Wagh, Yogesh Ravindra Deshpande, Gururaj Jayram Tuptewar, Rahul Manohar Pande, Sanjay alias Bharauo Vittal Chowdhari, Himanshu Panse and Rakesh Dhawade while Himanshu Panse had died in a blast in Nanded while he was preparing a bomb.  Later on 18 July 2012 all seven accused were acquitted in the case due to lack of evidence by a district and sessions court.\n\n3. On the 19 December 1974 the Provisional IRA exploded a car bomb which was parked opposite to Selfridge's department store on Oxford Street in London.  The bomb attack was carried out by an IRA active service unit (ASU) known as the Balcombe Street Gang who carried out some 40 attacks in England between October 1974 - December 1975.\n\n4. The Lewes bomb was a blast-incendiary field expedient explosive device, manufactured by mixing diesel oil and Nobel 808 plastic explosive.  It was created by Lieutenant Jock Lewes, one of the original members of L Detachment SAS in 1941.  The SAS needed a combined incendiary and explosive device light enough to be carried by a small group of commandos yet powerful enough to destroy and set fire to aircraft on an enemy airfield.  Weighing approximately 1 lb , the Lewes Bomb could be carried in quantity by an individual.\n\n5. The Nakajima Ki-49 \"Donryu\" (\u4e2d\u5cf6 \u30ad-49 \u5451\u9f8d ) \"Storm Dragon\" was a twin-engine Japanese bomber aircraft of World War II.  Despite its official designation as Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber, the requirements of the Ki-49 \u2013 to operate unescorted, with heavy defensive armament and armor \u2013 restricted it to a small bomb load, initially 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).\n\n6. A bomb vessel, bomb ship, bomb ketch, or simply bomb was a type of wooden sailing naval ship.  Its primary armament was not cannons (long guns or carronades)\u2014although bomb vessels carried a few cannons for self-defence\u2014but mortars mounted forward near the bow and elevated to a high angle, and projecting their fire in a ballistic arc.  Explosive shells (also called \"bombs\" at the time) or carcasses were employed rather than solid shot.  Bomb vessels were specialized ships designed for bombarding (hence the name) fixed positions on land.  In the 20th century, the same role was carried out by battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and the purpose-built World War I- and II-era monitors.\n\n7. The OFAB-100-120 is a small bomb can be carried on Sukhoi Su-17, Sukhoi Su-25 and Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft.\n\n8. The Sukhoi Su-25 \"Grach\" (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0447 (\"rook\"); NATO reporting name: Frogfoot) is a single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by Sukhoi.  It was designed to provide close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces.  The first prototype made its maiden flight on 22 February 1975.  After testing, the aircraft went into series production in 1978 at Tbilisi in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\n9. A Butterfly Bomb (or Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2\u00a0kg or SD2) was a German 2 kilogram anti-personnel submunition used by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War.  It was so named because the thin cylindrical metal outer shell which hinged open when the bomblet deployed gave it the superficial appearance of a large butterfly.  The design was very distinctive and easy to recognise.  SD2 bomblets were not dropped individually, but were packed into containers holding between 6 and 108 submunitions e.g. the AB 23 SD-2 and AB 250-3 submunition dispensers.  The SD2 submunitions were released after the container was released from the aircraft and had burst open.  Because SD2s were always dropped in groups (never individually) the discovery of one unexploded SD2 was a reliable indication that others had been dropped nearby.  This bomb type was one of the first cluster bombs ever used in combat and it proved to be a highly effective weapon.  The bomb containers that carried the SD2 bomblets and released them in the air were nicknamed the \"Devil's Eggs\" by Luftwaffe air and ground crew.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The OFAB-100-120 is a small bomb can be carried on Sukhoi Su-17, Sukhoi Su-25 and Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft.\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-25 \"Grach\" (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0447 (\"rook\"); NATO reporting name: Frogfoot) is a single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by Sukhoi.

The Skystone is a historical fiction novel written by Jack Whyte, which was first published in 1992.  The story is told by a Roman Officer called Publius Varrus, who is an expert blacksmith as well as a soldier.  In the early fifth century, amid the violent struggles between the people of Britain and the invading Saxons, Picts and Scots, he and his former General, Caius Britannicus, forge the government and military system that will become known as the Round Table, and initiate a chain of events that will lead to the coronation of the High King known as Arthur.\n\n1. Naram-Sin (also transcribed Nar\u0101m-S\u00een or Naram-Suen, meaning \"Beloved of Sin\"; reigned c. 2254\u20132218 BC,) was a ruler of the Akkadian Empire, the third successor and grandson of King Sargon of Akkad.  Under Naram-Sin the empire reached its maximum strength.  He was the first Mesopotamian king known to have claimed divinity for himself, taking the title \"God of Akkad\", and one of the first (following the earlier Lugal-Anne-Mundu) to claim the title \"King of the Four Quarters, King of the Universe\".\n\n2.

The Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan, also known as Pyramid of Baka and Pyramid of Bikheris is the term Archaeologists and Egyptologists use to describe a large shaft part of an unfinished pyramid at Zawyet El Aryan in Egypt.  It is dated by mainstream scholars to the early or the mid-4th Dynasty (2613\u20132494 BC) during the Old Kingdom period.  The pyramid owner is not known for certain and most egyptologists, such as Miroslav Verner, think it should be a king known under his hellenized name, Bikheris, perhaps from the Egyptian \"Baka\".  On the contrary, Wolfgang Helck and other egyptologists doubt this attribution.\n\n5. Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots (Latin: \"Malleus Scotorum\" ), was King of England from 1272 to 1307.  He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.  Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law.  Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs.\n\n6. The Battle of Evesham (4 August 1265) was one of the two main battles of 13th century England's Second Barons' War.  It marked the defeat of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and the rebellious barons by the future King Edward I, who led the forces of his father, King Henry III.  It took place on 4 August 1265, near the town of Evesham, Worcestershire.\n\n7. The King's School, Worcester (also known as King's Worcester or KSW; locally as simply King's; archaically \"Worcester Cathedral Grammar School\" or \"Worcester Cathedral King's School\") is an English independent school refounded by Henry VIII in 1541.  It occupies a site adjacent to Worcester Cathedral on the banks of the River Severn in the centre of the city of Worcester.  It offers mixed-sex mainstream education that follows the UK National Curriculum to around 1,465 pupils aged 2 to 18.  At age 11, approximately two thirds of pupils join the senior school from its two junior schools, King's Hawford and King's St Albans, while others come from maintained schools in the city of Worcester and the surrounding areas that include Malvern, Redditch, Kidderminster, Evesham and Pershore.\n\n8. Suktimati (Shuktimati, Sukti) was the capital city of the Chedi Kingdom in India.  It lay on the banks of the river Shuktimati flowing through Chedi.  It was built by a Chedi king known as Uparichara Vasu.  In the Mahabharata, it has been quoted that this river gave birth to twins (a boy and a girl) through its association with a mountain called Kolahala.  The river then gives the twins to king Uparichara Vasu.  King Vasu makes the boy the commander of his armies and marries the girl, Girika.\n\n9. Peter of Aigueblanche (or Peter of Aquablanca; died 27 November 1268) was a medieval Bishop of Hereford.  A nobleman from Savoy, he came to England as part of the party accompanying King Henry III's bride Eleanor of Provence.  He entered the royal service, becoming bishop in 1241.  He then served the king for a number of years as a diplomat, helping to arrange the marriage of Prince Edward.  Peter became embroiled in King Henry's attempts to acquire the kingdom of Sicily, and Peter's efforts to raise money towards that goal brought condemnation from the clergy and barons of England.  When the barons began to revolt against King Henry in the late 1250s and early 1260s, Peter was attacked and his lands and property pillaged.  He was arrested briefly in 1263 by the barons, before being mostly restored to his lands after the Battle of Evesham.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Edward I (17/18 June 1239 \u2013 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots (Latin: \"Malleus Scotorum\" ), was King of England from 1272 to 1307.

Many of these have become viral videos; the 2006 video for \"Here It Goes Again\", in which the band performed a complex routine with the aid of motorized treadmills, has received over 50 million views four years later.  Their video for Needing/Getting, released February 5, 2012 in partnership with Chevrolet, debuted during Super Bowl XLVI and has over 32 million views on YouTube.  Samuel Bayer, who produced many music videos in the 1990s, asserted that OK Go's promotion of music videos on the Internet was akin to Nirvana's ushering in the grunge movement.  Many of the videos also use long or single-shot takes, which \"Salon\"' s Matt Zoller Seitz says \"restore[s] a sense of wonder to the musical number by letting the performers' humanity shine through and allowing them to do their thing with a minimum of filmmaking interference\".  The success of OK Go's music first won the band the 14th Annual Webby Special Achievement Award for Film and Video Artist of the Year.

Meyer & Berenberg was a London trading firm active in the West Indies trade in the late 17th and early 18th century.  It was founded in the late 17th century by Sir Peter Meyer, a London merchant and a native of Hamburg who became an English citizen, and members of the Berenberg family, who originally belonged to the Dutch merchant colony of Hamburg and who likewise became English citizens.  It was one of the largest international trade (import\u2013export) companies of London of the era.  It should not be confused with Berenberg Bank, founded by the main branch of the same family.\n\n3. The territory of the present United States state of New Hampshire has a colonial history dating back to the 1620s.  This history is significantly bound to that of the neighboring Massachusetts, whose colonial precursors either claimed the New Hampshire territory, or shared governors with it.  First settled in the 1620s under a land grant to John Mason, the colony consisted of a small number of settlements near the seacoast before growing further inland in the 18th century.  Mason died in 1635, and the colonists appropriated a number of his holdings.  Thomas Roberts served as the last Colonial Governor of the Dover Colony before it became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.  In 1641 the New Hampshire colonists agreed to be ruled by Massachusetts Bay Colony, which also claimed the territory.  Massachusetts governed the New Hampshire settlements until 1680, when it became the royally chartered Province of New Hampshire.  In 1686 the territory became part of the Dominion of New England, which was effectively disbanded in 1689 following the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England.  After an interregnum under \"de facto\" rule from Massachusetts, Samuel Allen, who had acquired the Mason land claims, became governor.  From 1699 to 1741 the governorships of New Hampshire and the Province of Massachusetts Bay were shared.\n\n4. The Basques were among the first to catch whales commercially, and dominated the trade for five centuries, spreading to the far corners of the North Atlantic and even reaching the South Atlantic.  The French explorer Samuel de Champlain, when writing about Basque whaling in Terranova (i.e. Newfoundland), described them \"as the cleverest men at this fishing\".  By the early 17th century, other nations entered the trade in earnest, seeking the Basques as tutors, \"for [they] were then the only people who understand whaling\", lamented the English explorer Jonas Poole.  Having learned the trade themselves, other nations adopted their techniques and soon dominated the burgeoning industry \u2013 often to the exclusion of their former instructors.  Basque whaling peaked in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, but was in decline by the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  By the 19th century, it was moribund as the right whale was nearly extinct and the bowhead whale was decimated.\n\n5. Laing House of Plainfield Plantation is a historic house in Edison, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States, built in the early 18th century when the region was being settled by Scottish Quakers in the late 17th and early 18th century, as recalled in the name of The Plainfields and Scotch Plains.  The region was part of the colonial era Elizabethtown Tract and later part of Piscataway Township.  It is not certain whether the name derives from the plain clothing worn by the founders or is a reference to the landscape.  The house was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\n6. The William Murray House is a historic First Period house at 39 Essex Street on the east side of Salem, Massachusetts.  It is a two story wood frame house that consists of two distinct sections that have not always been treated as a single unit.  Its construction history provides a window into 17th and 18th century building methods.  The westernmost section was built c. 1688, and is three window bays wide and a single room in depth.  The eastern section, also three bays wide and one room deep, was added in the late 17th or early 18th century.  The western portion originally had an overhanging section of the second floor; this was altered in the early 18th century, when the roof was raised to a flatter pitch and the overhanging section was concealed by construction of a flush wall.\n\n7. Peter Sergeant (died 1714) was a merchant in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in the late 17th and early 18th century.  Born in England, he moved to Boston and prospered as a merchant.

He was a member of the Third Church congregation attending services at the Cedar House and later at the Old South Meeting House.  He was also associated with the New England Company.  During the 1689 Boston revolt, he participated in the Committee of Safety that ousted governor Edmund Andros.  In 1679, Sergeant built a large house on old Marlborough Street, and lived there for most of the rest of his life.  He left briefly 1699\u2013ca.1700, in order to accommodate royal governor Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont.  (After 1716 the Sergeant House was known as the Province House).  Sergeant married four times: to Elizabeth Corwin; to Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Shrimpton (1682\u20131700); to Mary Phips (1701\u20131706); and to Mehitable Cooper (1706\u20131714).  His funeral was held on February 13, 1714; he is buried in the Granary Burying Ground.\n\n8. Hausmalerei (German: \"home painting\" ) is a tradition originating with the freelance enamelers on glass in Bohemia but developed in Germany on white tin-glazed earthenware in the 17th century, in which glazed and fired but unpainted wares \"in the white\" were purchased on speculation by unsupervised freelance ateliers of china painters, who decorated them in overglaze enamel colours and gilding, which were fixed by further firing in their own kilns.  A few such freelance decorators of faience operated in Nuremberg in the late 17th century, but \"hausmalerei\" developed in Augsburg into a notable feature of tin-glazed earthenware production during the early 18th century, before the workshops turned entirely to porcelain.  \"Hausmalerei\" reached am artistic pinnacle with paintings on Meissen porcelain and Vienna porcelain in the second quarter of the 18th century; sometimes Meissen porcelains remained blank for decades before they were painted.\n\n9. The Maratha emperors, from the early 17th century to the early 18th century, built and ruled the Maratha Empire on the Indian subcontinent, mainly corresponding to the modern countries of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. )  Their power rapidly dwindled during the 18th century and the last of the emperors was deposed in 1818, with the establishment of the British Raj.  At their empire's greatest extent in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, they controlled much of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Bengal in the east to Atak and Sindh in the west, Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri basin in the south.  Peshwas served as subordinates to the Chhatrapati (the Maratha king), but later, they became the leaders of the Marathas, and the Chatrapati was reduced to a nominal ruler.

Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen (1610, Rotterdam - 1653, The Hague) was a Dutch mathematician famous for his published work on spherical trigonometry.  In 1638 he moved to The Hague to become tutor of William II, Prince of Orange.  In 1644 he was employed to tutor Christiaan Huygens in mathematics.\n\n1. Treatise on Light (French: \"Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re\" ) is a 1690 book written by the Dutch polymath Christiaan Huygens on his wave theory of light.  Huygens' starting point was Descartes' theory, as presented in the \"Dioptrique\", which Huygens aimed to supplant.  Huygens' theory is also seen as the historical rival of Newton's theory, which was presented in the \"Opticks\".\n\n2. Huygens was an atmospheric entry probe that landed successfully on Saturn's moon Titan in 2005.  Built and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), it was part of the \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" mission and became the first spacecraft ever to land on Titan and the furthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made.  It was also the first landing on a moon other than our own.  The probe was named after the Dutch 17th-century astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655.\n\n3. A tractrix (from the Latin verb \"trahere\" \"pull, drag\"; plural: tractrices) is the curve along which an object moves, under the influence of friction, when pulled on a horizontal plane by a line segment attached to a tractor (pulling) point that moves at a right angle to the initial line between the object and the puller at an infinitesimal speed.  It is therefore a curve of pursuit.  It was first introduced by Claude Perrault in 1670, and later studied by Isaac Newton (1676) and Christiaan Huygens (1692).\n\n4. Christiaan Huygens, FRS ( or ; ] ) (Latin: \"Hugenius\" ) (14 April 1629 \u2013 8 July 1695) was a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist.

This article provides a Timeline of the Cassini\u2013Huygens ( ) (commonly called Cassini) mission.  \"Cassini\" was a collaboration between the United States' NASA, the European Space Agency (\"ESA\"), and the Italian Space Agency (\"ASI\") to send a probe to study the planet Saturn and its system, including its rings and natural satellites.  The Flagship-class unmanned robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's \"Cassini\" probe, and ESA's \"Huygens\" lander module which would be landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan.  \"Cassini\" was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit.  The craft were named after astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.\n\n7. An aerial telescope is a type of very long focal length refracting telescope, built in the second half of the 17th century, that did not use a tube.  Instead, the objective was mounted on a pole, tree, tower, building or other structure on a swivel ball-joint.  The observer stood on the ground and held the eyepiece, which was connected to the objective by a string or connecting rod.  By holding the string tight and maneuvering the eyepiece, the observer could aim the telescope at objects in the sky.  The idea for this type of telescope may have originated in the late 17th century with the Dutch mathematician, astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens and his brother Constantijn Huygens, Jr., though it is not clear if they actually invented it.\n\n8. Hendrik van Heuraet (1633, Haarlem - 1660? , Leiden) was a Dutch mathematician also known as Henrici van Heuraet.  He is noted as one of the founders of the integral, and author of \"Epistola de Transmutatione Curvarum Linearum in Rectus\" [\"On the Transformation of Curves into Straight Lines\"] (1659).  From 1653 he studied at Leiden University where he interacted with Frans van Schooten, Johannes Hudde, and Christiaan Huygens.  In 1658 he and Hudde left for Saumur in France.  He returned to Leiden the next year as a physician.  After this his trail is lost.\n\n9.

The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics.  The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand.  The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea.  The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands.  Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings.  Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens.\n\n4. The Calyptocephalellidae are a family of toads found in Chile containing two genera, \"Calyptocephalella\" and \"Telmatobufo\".  The \"Calyptocephalella\" genus contains one species, \"C. gayi\", the helmeted water toad, which is a large aquatic toad weighing up to 0.5 kg .  The \"Telmatobufo\" genus contains four species, \"T. australis\", \"T. bullocki\", \"T. ignotus\", and \"T. venustus\".  All species within the family are considered threatened, with \"T. bullocki\" and \"T. venustus\" being classified as critically endangered.\n\n5. Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae.  The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or \"cones\" of various species of \"Banksia\", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia.  Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10\u00a0mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the \"Banksia\" fruit.  The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits.  The first specimens of \"Banksiamyces\", known then as \"Tympanis toomansis\", were described in 1887.  Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, \"B.\u00a0katerinae\", \"B.\u00a0macrocarpus\", and \"B.\u00a0toomansis\".  A fourth species, \"B.\u00a0maccannii\", was added in 1984.\n\n6. Heliotropium is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae.  There are 250 to 300 species in this genus, which are commonly known as heliotropes (sg.  /\u02c8hi\u02d0li.\u0259tro\u028ap/ ).\n\n7. Lophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae.  The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution.  Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves.  In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter.  In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens.  The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera.  Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations.  In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.\n\n8. Leptofoenus is a genus of wasp in the family Pteromalidae, the type genus subfamily Leptofoeninae found in South, Central, and southern North America.  The genus contains five living species and one extinct species known from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola.  With body sizes ranging from 11 - \"Leptofoenus\" species are larger than nearly all other species in Pteromalidae.  The genus bears a notable resemblance to the wasp families Pelecinidae, Gasteruptiidae, and Stephanidae.\n\n9. Calendula ( ), is a genus of about 15\u201320 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the daisy family Asteraceae that are often known as marigolds.

It offered video game news, coverage of industry events, interviews with gaming figureheads, editorial content, and product reviews.\n\n1. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine (often abbreviated to OPM) is a now-defunct monthly video game magazine, published by Ziff Davis Media.  It was a sister publication of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".  The magazine focused exclusively on PlayStation hardware, software, and culture, covering the original PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable.  Perhaps the most famous aspect of the magazine was the inclusion each month of a disc that contained playable demos and videos of PlayStation games.  The magazine was produced for nearly ten years, from October 1997 to the final issue in January 2007.\n\n2. 1UP Shows and Podcasts were a collection of podcasts hosted by 1UP. com dealing with various aspects of gaming.  Most of the shows, like \"4 Guys 1UP\", were about games and general gaming culture.  Others were more specific, such as \"The Sports Game Guy's Sports Anomaly\", which focused on sports games.  The network also featured \"Retronauts\", an audio retrospective series that chronicled various retro games and game series.  The network had shown significant growth, with several new shows having been introduced in 2007-2008.  However, in early 2009 1UP. com was purchased by UGO and its parent company Hearst Corporation from Ziff Davis Media.  This resulted not only in the closure of Electronic Gaming Monthly, but also the loss of over 30 jobs, including several hosts and producers of the site's many podcasts.  Because of this, more than half of the network's shows were abruptly discontinued, leaving only a few remaining.  While \"1UP Yours\" did not cease to exist, the resignation of the show's co-host Shane Bettenhausen led host Garnett Lee to change the show's name and structure to \"Listen UP\".  Several former employees also started their own projects after the firings as well, including \"Co-Op\", the spiritual successor to \"The 1UP Show\", \"Rebel FM\", the follow-up to \"1UP FM\", and \"The Geekbox\", Ryan Scott's replacement for \"Lan Party\" podcast (formerly \"GFW Radio\").\n\n3.

The magazine was unusual among multiconsole magazines in that it covered PC as well as console games, as well as its minimalistic cover art, and, in its last few months, its shift in focus toward promotion of less mainstream titles.  It lasted exactly two years, as the 25th and last issue (which was only sent to subscribers) was the February 2005 edition (though prints were limited and not even all subscribers received the final issue).\n\n4.

According to an article posted on the PlayStation Blog by producer (and former \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" editor-in-chief) James Mielke, \"Our goal was simple.  We wanted to tell a story through sound.  With this in mind, our song selection was done to replicate a groovy lounge instead of trying to develop a non-stop 140BPM megamix.  The soundtrack is designed to rise and fall like waves, giving the player both rhythm and respite, which would feel like a musical journey.\"\n\n9.

An Erotic thriller is a film genre defined by a thriller with a thematic basis in illicit romance or erotic fantasy.  Though most erotic thrillers contain scenes of softcore sex, the frequency and explicitness of those scenes varies.  If a film is a thriller with scenes of softcore sex or nudity, it is probably not an erotic thriller unless illicit romance or erotic fantasy is central to the dramatic conflict, as in \"Body Heat\", \"Fatal Attraction\", and \"Night Eyes 3\".  Many crime thrillers, action films, and slasher films contain softcore sex and/or nudity but are not erotic thrillers.  Likewise, if a film is not identifiably a thriller, it is probably not an erotic thriller but simply a work of softcore erotica or perhaps even erotic melodrama.\n\n6.

The field dried leaves, stalk and seed pod are used in commercial manufacture of morphine or other poppy alkaloid derived drugs, by first processing the material to make poppy straw separating the seeds then making concentrate of poppy straw, where no extraction using traditional methods of latex extraction has been made.  The straw was originally considered an agricultural by-product of the mechanised poppy seed harvest, which was primarily grown for its edible and oil-producing seed.  This changed in 1927 when J\u00e1nos Kabay developed a chemical process to extract morphine from the crushed capsule.  Concentrated poppy straw consisting mainly of the crushed capsule without the seeds soon became a valuable source of morphine.  Today, concentrate of poppy straw is a major source of many opiates and other alkaloids It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use) and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin.\n\n1. Papaver nudicaule (syn.  \"Papaver croceum\", \"P. miyabeanum\", \"P. amurense\", and \"P. macounii\"), the Iceland poppy, is a boreal flowering plant.  Native to subpolar regions of Europe, Asia and North America, and the mountains of Central Asia (but not in Iceland), Iceland poppies are hardy but short-lived perennials, often grown as biennials, that yield large, papery, bowl-shaped, lightly fragrant flowers supported by hairy, one foot, curved stems among feathery blue-green foliage 1-6\u00a0inches long.  They were first described by botanists in 1759.  The wild species blooms in white or yellow, and is hardy from USDA Zones 3a-10b.  All parts of this plant are likely to be poisonous, containing (like all poppies) toxic alkaloids.  In particular, \"P. nudicaule\" has been shown to contain the benzophenanthidine alkaloid, chelidonine.  It also contains (+)-amurine, (-)-amurensinine, (-)-O-methylthalisopavine, (-)-flavinantine and (-)-amurensine.\n\n2. Romneya trichocalyx, the bristly Matilija poppy or hairy Matilija poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the poppy family.  This poppy is native to San Diego, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties in California, as well as Baja California, Mexico, where it grows in dry canyons in chaparral and coastal sage scrub plant communities.  Like its relative \"Romneya coulteri\", it is used as an ornamental plant, kept for its large, showy flowers.\n\n3. Papaver rupifragum is a species of flowering plant in the poppy family, Papaveraceae\n\n4. Meconic acid, also known as acidum meconicum and poppy acid, is a chemical substance found in certain plants of the Papaveraceae family (poppy) such as \"Papaver somniferum\" (opium poppy) and \"Papaver bracteatum\".  Meconic acid constitutes about 5% of opium and can be used as an analytical marker for the presence of opium.  Meconic acid has erroneously been described as a mild narcotic, but it has little or no physiological activity, and is not used medicinally.  Meconic acid forms salts with alkaloids and metals.  These salts as well as meconic acid esters are called meconates.  Meconic acid was first isolated by Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner in 1805.\n\n5. A Good Thing Lost is a compilation album by The Poppy Family, released in 1996 in Canada and later on iTunes in America with a second cover.  The compilation was essentially The Poppy Family's greatest hits collection but also included a number of Susan Jacks' solo recordings.  The album featured an alternate mix of \"There's No Blood In Bone\" and previously unreleased track \"Evil Overshadows Joe\", along with the U.S. version of \"That's Where I Went Wrong\" with the lead guitar being recorded in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n6. Corokia is a genus in the Argophyllaceae family comprising about ten species native to New Zealand and one native to Australia.  \"Corokia\" species are shrubs or small trees with zigzagging (divaricating) branches.  In fact, \"Corokia cotoneaster\" is commonly known as \"wire-netting bush\".  The stems of the shrubs are dark when mature, covered with downy or silky hairs (tomentum) when young.  In spring, they produce clusters of small, star shaped yellow blossoms.  Berries are red or yellow.  The shrubs prefer forests and rocky areas, sun or light shade, reasonably well drained soil, and moderate watering.\n\n7. Papaver rhoeas (common names include common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy or red poppy) is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family, Papaveraceae.  This poppy is notable as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including \"corn\" and \"field\") and after World War I as a symbol of dead soldiers.\n\n8. A poppy is a flowering plant in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae.  Poppies are herbaceous plants, often grown for their colorful flowers.  One species of poppy, \"Papaver somniferum\", is the source of the crude drug opium which contains powerful medicinal alkaloids such as morphine and has been used since ancient times as an analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drug.  It also produces edible seeds.  Following the trench warfare which took place in the poppy fields of Flanders during World War I, poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime.\n\n9. Papaver is a genus of 70\u2013100 species of frost-tolerant annuals, biennials, and perennials native to temperate and cold regions of Eurasia, Africa and North America.

The J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar Saga (in full Saga J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar konungs hins helga), is an Icelandic saga about the life of Edward the Confessor, King of England (1042\u20131066).  It was compiled in the 14th century, in Iceland, using a number of earlier English sources as well as the French \"Chronicon Universale Anonymi Laudunensis\" (or a source common with it).  It was translated into English in 1894 by G. W. Dasent.  Among the various details contained in the saga, there is an account of the origin of an English colony in the Black Sea founded by one \"Siward earl of Gloucester\" (\"Sigur\u00f0r jarl af Glocestr\"), a refugee of the Norman Conquest of England.\n\n1. Euthymius Zigabenus or Zigadenus or Zygadenus (Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0396\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 or \u0396\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2; died after 1118) was a 12th-century monk and commentator on the Bible.  He was a friend of the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, for whom he wrote a lengthy work on heresies, \"Panoplia Dogmatica\" or \"Panoply of Doctrine\" (or \"Full Armour of Belief\").  This began in the apostolic era and continued down to the Bogomils, some of whom he personally examined.  The entry on the Bogomils is our main source of information about them.  Nothing is known about his life.\n\n2. Alexios IV Angelos or Alexius IV Angelus (Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394' \u0386\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) (c. 1182 \u2013 8 February 1204) was Byzantine Emperor from August 1203 to January 1204.  He was the son of Emperor Isaac II Angelus and his first wife, an unknown Palaiologina, who became a nun with the name Irene.  His paternal uncle was Emperor Alexius III Angelus.\n\n3. New England (Latin: \"Nova Anglia\" ) was a colony allegedly founded in the late 11th century by English refugees fleeing William the Conqueror.  Its existence is only attested in two sources, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, the French \"Chronicon Universale Anonymi Laudunensis\" and the Icelandic \"J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar Saga\".  They tell the story of a journey from England through the Mediterranean Sea that led to Constantinople, where the English refugees fought off a siege by heathens and were rewarded by the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus.  A group of them were given land to the north-east of the Black Sea, reconquering it and renaming their territory \"New England\".  Though these sources are late, New England is thought by some historians to be based on a reality.\n\n4. Alexios Komnenos, latinised as Alexius Comnenus (Greek: ), was the eldest son of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos and his wife Eirene of Hungary.  He was born in February 1106 at Balabista in Macedonia, was made co-emperor with his father at 16 or 17 years of age and died on 2 August 1142 at Attalia, Pamphylia.  He was an elder brother of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and had a twin sister, Maria Komnene (plus other siblings).\n\n5. Basil the Physician (died 1118) was the Bogomil leader condemned as a heretic by Patriarch Nicholas III of Constantinople and burned at the stake by Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus.\n\n6. Theodora Angelina was the only daughter of Anna Angelina and the \"sebastocrator\" Isaac Comnenus.

He was the son of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos and Maria, daughter of Raymond of Poitiers, prince of Antioch.  He was the long-awaited male heir and was named Alexius as a fulfilment of the AIMA prophecy.\n\n8. Perama (Greek: \u03a0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 ) is a town and a former municipality in the Ioannina regional unit, Epirus, Greece.  Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Ioannina, of which it is a municipal unit.  It lies about 4\u00a0km north of central Ioannina.  The town's name means \"passage\" and it lies on the northern edge of lake Pamvotis (Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2).  It is famous for its cave, known as the \"Cave of Perama\" (Greek \u03a3\u03c0\u03ae\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2).  The cave, extending five kilometres below the ground and having been explored fully only up to one kilometre, has a remarkable arrangement of stalagmites and stalactites.  An 11th-century church in the town dedicated to Saint Haralambos and reputedly built by Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comnenus is in a bad state of repair and is rarely open to the general public.  The town lies on GR-6 between Igoumenitsa and Metsovo.\n\n9. Alexios I Megas Komnenos or Alexius I Megas Comnenus (Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u0384 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, \"Alexios I Megas Komn\u0113nos\" ; c. 1182 \u2013 1 February 1222) was, with his brother David, the founder of the Empire of Trebizond, which he ruled from 1204 until his death in 1222.  The two brothers were the only male descendants of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I, who had been dethroned and killed in 1185, and thus claimed to represent the legitimate government of the Empire following the conquest of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204.  Although his rivals governing the Nicaean Empire succeeded in becoming the de facto successors, and rendered his dynastic claims to the imperial throne moot, Alexios' descendants continued to emphasize both their heritage and connection to the Komnenian dynasty by referring to themselves as Megas Komnenos or Grand Komnenos.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "New England (Latin: \"Nova Anglia\" ) was a colony allegedly founded in the late 11th century by English refugees fleeing William the Conqueror.

Gods and Generals is a novel which serves as a prequel to Michael Shaara's 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning work about the Battle of Gettysburg, \"The Killer Angels\".  Written by Jeffrey Shaara after his father Michael's death in 1988, the novel relates events from 1858 through 1863 during the American Civil War, ending just as the two armies march toward Gettysburg.  Since 1988, Jeff Shaara has written \"The Last Full Measure\", which follows the events presented in \"The Killer Angels\".\n\n1. Michael Shaara (June 23, 1928 \u2013 May 5, 1988) was an American author of science fiction, sports fiction, and historical fiction.

In the essay Camus takes an uncompromising position for the abolition of the death penalty.  Camus's view is similar to that of Cesare Beccaria and the Marquis de Sade, the latter having also argued that murder premeditated and carried out by the state was the worst kind.  Camus states that he does not base his argument on sympathy for the convicted but on logical grounds and on proven statistics.  Camus also argues that capital punishment is an easy option for the government where remedy and reform may be possible.\n\n3.

The action begins with the Battle of Vera Cruz and follows Winfield Scott and his army as they march toward Mexico City, including the Battle of Cerro Gordo and culminating in the Battle of Chapultepec and the fall of Mexico City.\n\n8. The Fall (French: La Chute ) is a philosophical novel by Albert Camus.  First published in 1956, it is his last complete work of fiction.  Set in Amsterdam, \"The Fall\" consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed \"judge-penitent\" Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger.  In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues; his crisis, and his ultimate \"fall\" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden.  \"The Fall\" explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth.  In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described the novel as \"perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood\" of Camus' books.\n\n9.

In probability theory, Kolmogorov's inequality is a so-called \"maximal inequality\" that gives a bound on the probability that the partial sums of a finite collection of independent random variables exceed some specified bound.  The inequality is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.\n\n1. In mathematics, Kolmogorov's normability criterion is a theorem that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological vector space to be normable, i.e. for the existence of a norm on the space that generates the given topology.  The normability criterion can be seen as a result in same vein as the Nagata\u2013Smirnov metrization theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable.  The result was proved by the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolayevich Kolmogorov in 1934.\n\n2. In Kolmogorov's probability theory, the probability \"P\" of some event \"E\", denoted formula_1, is usually defined such that \"P\" satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, which are described below.\n\n3.

In mathematics, specifically in the theory of Markovian stochastic processes in probability theory, the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process.  The equation was derived independently by both the British mathematician Sydney Chapman and the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.\n\n5. In mathematics, the Hahn\u2013Kolmogorov theorem characterizes when a finitely additive function with non-negative (possibly infinite) values can be extended to a \"bona fide\" measure.  It is named after the Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn and the Russian/Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.\n\n6. In mathematics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem (also known as Kolmogorov existence theorem or Kolmogorov consistency theorem) is a theorem that guarantees that a suitably \"consistent\" collection of finite-dimensional distributions will define a stochastic process.  It is credited to the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.\n\n7. In mathematics, the Kolmogorov continuity theorem is a theorem that guarantees that a stochastic process that satisfies certain constraints on the moments of its increments will be continuous (or, more precisely, have a \"continuous version\").

The Morris J. Berman oil spill occurred on January 7, 1994, when the \"Morris J. Berman\", a single-hull 302-foot-long barge, with the capacity to carry more than 3 million gallons of oil, collided with a coral reef near San Juan, Puerto Rico, causing the release of 750,000 gallons of heavy grade oil.  The spill affected the tourism and fishing industries as well as wildlife along the shores of Puerto Rico, Isla de Culebra, and Isla de Vieques.  The spill had major long-lasting impacts on the biological and natural resources of the entire Puerto Rican area.  This spill was also the first to occur in U.S. waters after the passing of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n\n1. Automotive oil recycling involves the recycling of used oils and the creation of new products from the recycled oils, and includes the recycling of motor oil and hydraulic oil.

Its elevation of 4028 m makes it the third highest mountain pass in Kyrgyzstan after Bedel Pass and Kyzylart Pass, and the highest one that is not on a border.  It connects the Ala-Bel plateau, where the Kumtor Gold Mine is located, to the upper Naryn River valley.\n\n2. Raynolds Pass, elevation 6844 ft , is a mountain pass on the Montana-Idaho border in the Rocky Mountains, United States.  The pass is on the Continental Divide, and is traversed by a state highway (Idaho State Highway 87 and Montana Highway 87).  The pass is named for Captain William F. Raynolds, an early explorer and officer-in-charge of the Raynolds Expedition of the Yellowstone region.  The pass is very gentle, with only a slight grade and no major hairpin curves to the highways connections with U.S. Route 287 in Montana and U.S. Route 20 in Idaho.\n\n3. Elk Park Pass, elevation 6352 ft , is a mountain pass on the Continental Divide in southwestern Montana, about 4 mi northeast of Butte.  It is traversed by Interstate 15 and is one of three crossings of the Divide by the Interstate (all in Montana), the others being Monida Pass (on the border with Idaho) and Deer Lodge Pass southwest of Butte.  Elk Park Pass lies on the border between Silver Bow and Jefferson counties and is remarkable for its highly asymmetrical nature.  The approach from the north is through namesake Elk Park, a high, mostly treeless plain (like South Park in Colorado or the Sierra Valley in California), and the grade is almost imperceptible.  The elevation at the northeast end of the park, about 10 mi from the pass, is about 6200 ft , only 152 ft lower than the pass itself.  However, at the south end, the highway drops 750 ft from the pass into Butte over a distance of only about 4 mi .\n\n4.

Lewis and Clark Pass, el.  6424 ft is a mountain pass on the continental divide in Montana.  It lies at the head of the drainages of the west flowing Blackfoot River and the east flowing Dearborn River.  The pass is in the Helena National Forest in Lewis and Clark County.  The Continental Divide Trail traverses north and south through the pass.  At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition the pass was a much-used pathway where the native people living in what today is Montana crossed over the continental divide.  The pass was crossed by Meriwether Lewis on July 7, 1806, on the return leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a party of nine men and his dog Seaman.  The pass was named for the expedition's two leaders\u2013Lewis and William Clark.  Lewis and Clark Pass is the only roadless pass on the entire Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.  It has gone from being one of the most used continental divide passes prior to the pioneer era to one of the least visited passes today.  It can be accessed by a 1.5 mi trail.  Visitors will encounter the pass much as Lewis did in 1806.  The furrows left by the countless dog and horse travois that crossed the pass are still visible (though fading) and this is one of the places along the expedition's route that visitors may still encounter a grizzly bear.  On a clear day, like Meriwether Lewis in 1806 one can see Square Butte in Cascade County, Montana, 40 mi to the northeast.\n\n8.

A game show is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money or prizes.  Alternatively, a \"gameshow\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony).  In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants.  On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score.  Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement.  One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows.  Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.\n\n5. Canada's Next Top Model (sometimes abbreviated as CNTM) is a Canadian reality show in which female contestants compete for the title \"Canada's Next Top Model\" and a chance to start their career in the modeling industry.

The team which fulfills this directive wins the game and the losing team must then sacrifice a team member.  The final episode saw the remaining (three) contestants compete to uncover a \u00a350,000 hidden treasure.

The publication stated that \"no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side\".

He also won Best in Show at the National Dog Show in 2005, and on retirement trained as a therapy dog.  He is the most successful Colored Bull Terrier Show Dog of all time.\n\n2. The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog in the terrier family.  There is also a miniature version of this breed which is officially known as the Miniature Bull Terrier.\n\n3. Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog.  Formal breeds often considered in North America to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.  Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers.  After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions.  Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity, and pit bulls are a common breed of choice.\n\n4. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a dog breed.  It is a medium-sized, solidly-built, intelligent, short-haired dog whose early ancestors came from the British Isles.  When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier (another breed within the type commonly called pit bulls), the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6 - in height and 25 - in weight.  The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size.  Males normally are about 18-21 inches (45\u201353\u00a0cm) in height and around 35-60 pounds (15\u201327\u00a0kg) in weight.  Females are normally around 17-20 inches (43\u201350\u00a0cm) in height and 30-50 pounds (13\u201322\u00a0kg) in weight.\n\n5.

The Bull and Terrier is a breed of dog that was the progenitor of the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Bull Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\n7. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.\n\n8. The Chamuco (a Mexican word which means \"devil\") or Mexican Pitbull is a dog breed not recognized by any Canofile association.

Its name comes from the Mexican slang \"Chamuco\", which means devil because of its temperament and tenacity.  Also it called Mexican pitbull or miniature pitbull, but actually is Dogo of Mexican origin.\n\n9. The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to \"Airedale\"), also called Bingley Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that originated in the valley (\"dale\") of the River Aire, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  It is traditionally called the \"King of Terriers\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds.  The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Bull Terrier, the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, originally to serve as an all around working farm dog.  In Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and police dog.  In the United States, this breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog in the terrier family.

Abraham the Monk was a monk who lived in a monastery on Mount Sinai in the Sinai desert.  He was born about the close of the sixth century, and became a convert to Judaism about 615.  As a Christian monk, he spent his life in penance and prayer.  Doubts as to the Christian dogma grew in his mind, and, after a prolonged struggle, he deserted his cell in the monastery on Mount Sinai and wandered North through the desert into the Land of Israel, finally reaching the city of Tiberias.  Here he submitted to circumcision and became a Jew, receiving the name Abraham, by which he was subsequently known.\n\n1.

He is known for discovery of a fundamental mechanism of chaos (hyperbolicity) in Dynamical systems, which is called mechanism of defocusing.  The most famous class of chaotic dynamical systems of this type Dynamical billiards are focusing chaotic billiards (e.g., the \"Bunimovich stadium\",\"Bunimovich flowers\", etc.).  More recently he introduced so called Bunimovich mushrooms, which are visual examples of billiards with mixed regular and chaotic dynamics.  In many labs over the world were built experimental devices in the form of various Bunimovich billiards.  He received bachelor's degree in 1967 and PhD in 1973 from the University of Moscow.

The Armenian inscriptions of Sinai refer to nearly 110 ancient Armenian inscriptions that were found in the Sinai Peninsula.  The Armenian inscriptions found in Sinai indicate an earlier pilgrimage before 919 and after the Islamic conquest.  The outcome of searches concluded that 113 inscriptions in the Armenian language were found in the Sinai peninsula, and 20 in the Georgian language.  The inscriptions dating back to the 5th century provide evidence of Armenians traveling to the holy land in large numbers, the second largest people to visit.  One source mentions nearly 400 people, and another with around 800 people.  The inscriptions give evidence of Armenians being among the pilgrims to Mount Sinai.\n\n9.

Chinese folklore features a rich variety of ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural creatures.  According to traditional beliefs a ghost is the spirit form of a person who has died.  Ghosts are typically malevolent and will cause harm to the living if provoked.  Many Chinese folk beliefs about ghosts have been adopted into the mythologies and folklore of neighboring cultures, notably Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia.  Beliefs about ghosts are closely associated with Chinese ancestor worship, where much have been incorporated into Taoism.  Later beliefs were influenced by Buddhism and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs about the supernatural.\n\n1.

There are also many alleged haunted sites in this region.  It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth.  The common word for ghosts in Bengali is \"bhoot\" or \"bhut\" (Bengali: \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 ).  This word has an alternative meaning: 'past' in Bengali.  Also, the word \"Pret\" (derived from Sanskrit 'Preta') is used in Bengali to mean ghost.

These categories referred to the running time of the short: a reel of film, in this context, being 1000 feet or less, or about 11 minutes.  A third category \"Best Short Subject, color\" was used only for 1936 and 1937.

Hollywood on Television was a five-and-a-half-hour, six-day-a-week live television talk show starring newcomer Betty White and radio disc jockey Al Jarvis that ran from 1949 to 1953.  When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned.  White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result.  After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches.  Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step.  Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches.  Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes.  Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".\n\n6.

The Email Privacy Act is a bill introduced in the United States Congress.  The bipartisan proposed federal law is sponsored by Representative Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas, and Representative Jared Polis, a Democrat of Colorado.  The law is designed to update and reform existing online communications law, specifically the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986.  In the 113th Congress (2013-14), the bill never made it out of subcommittee.  In the 114th Congress (2015-16), the bill was unanimously passed by the House, but was derailed in the Senate following a series of weakening amendments offered by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate Majority Whip.  In the 115th Congress (2017-18), it was passed by the House on a voice vote.\n\n2. The United States Marshals Service (USMS) is a federal law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Justice (see ).  It is the oldest American federal law enforcement agency, which was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 during the presidency of George Washington.  The Marshals Service is attached to the Executive branch of government, and is the enforcement arm of the federal courts.  It is the primary agency for fugitive operations, responsible for prisoner transport, the protection of officers of the court, and for the effective operation of the judiciary.  The Marshals Service operates the Witness Protection Program, and serves federal level arrest warrants.\n\n3. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land.  It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied.  Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law.  In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain national acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with national law.  In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that \"Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.\"  A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, at least when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself.  No matter what the federal government or the states might wish to do, they have to stay within the boundaries of the Constitution.  This makes the Supremacy Clause the cornerstone of the whole American political structure.\n\n4. Geier v. American Honda Motor Company, 529 U.S. 861 (2000) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a federal automobile safety standard pre-empted a stricter state rule.

The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999 (CESA) is a bill proposed by the Clinton administration during the 106th United States Congress that enables the government to harvest keys used in encryption.  The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act gives law enforcement the ability to gain access to encryption keys and cryptography methods.  The initial version of this act enabled federal law enforcement agencies to secretly use monitoring, electronic capturing equipment and other technologies to access and obtain information.  These provisions were later stricken from the act, although federal law enforcement agencies still have a significant degree of latitude to conduct investigations relating to electronic information.  The act generated discussion about what capabilities should be allowed to law enforcement in the detection of criminal activity.  After vocal objections from civil liberties groups, the administration backed away from the controversial bill.\n\n7.

Responding to a wave of factory closings in Northeast Ohio, the coalition proposed state legislation to require advance notice to employees before a closing (1977).

Locustacarus buchneri is a parasitic mite that lives in the respiratory air sacs of bumblebees.  They are relatively host-specific and are found primarily in the subgenus \"Bombus sensu stricto\".  Bees infested with the mite have a reduced lifespan in laboratory conditions, and although in one study they foraged at a rate similar to uninfected bees, infected bees showed a greater preference for a single flower type.  Prevalence varies, but infection appears to be more common among commercial colonies than wild populations.  Among colonies commercially imported from the Netherlands and Belgium to Japan, infestation rates were 20%.  In South America, prevalence is very low in native populations.  In Canada, there was evidence that commercial bumblebee populations were spreading \"L. buchneri\" to wild populations.\n\n1. Vanishing of the Bees is a 2009 documentary film by Hive Mentality Films & Hipfuel Films, directed by George Langworthy and Maryam Henein and released in the United Kingdom in October 2009.  The story is centered on the sudden disappearance of honey bees from beehives around the world, caused by the poorly understood phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD.  Although the film does not draw any firm scientific conclusions as to the precise cause or causes of CCD, it does suggest a link between neonicotinoid pesticides and CCD.\n\n2. Peter Eric Enns (born January 2, 1961) is an American biblical scholar, theologian, and writer.  He has written widely on hermeneutics, the relationship between religion and science, the creation\u2013evolution controversy, and Old Testament interpretation.  Outside of his academic work Enns is a contributor to \"HuffPost\" and \"Patheos\".  He has also worked with Francis Collins' The BioLogos Foundation.  He is perhaps best known for his book \"Inspiration and Incarnation\", which challenged conservative/mainstream Evangelical methods of biblical interpretation.  He is also notable for his book \"The Evolution of Adam\", in which he questions the belief that Adam was a historical figure.  and his most recent books \"The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It\" and \"The Sin of Certainty: Why God Desires Our Trust More than Our 'Correct' Beliefs\".\n\n3. \"The Bible Tells Me So\" is a 1955 gospel pop hit written by Dale Evans.

The Bible tells how, along with Moses's rod, Aaron's rod was endowed with miraculous power during the Plagues of Egypt that preceded the Exodus.  There are two occasions where the Bible tells of the rod's power.\n\n5. Bumblebees (\"Bombus\" spp.) , like the honeybee (\"Apis\" spp.)  collect nectar and pollen from flowers and store them for food.  Many individuals must be recruited to forage for food to provide the hive.  Some bee species have highly developed ways of communicating with each other about the location and quality of food resources ranging from physical to chemical displays.  Honey bees are known for their specialized dances, such as the waggle dance which recruit other bees to the precise location of the food source.  Bumblebees are not capable of transmitting this type of detailed information.  Instead, the nest serves as a hub where bees receive information about the foraging bouts of her conspecifics.  Differences between the communication methods of honeybees and bumblebees are mainly due to differences in colony size and nest structure.  Bumblebees are distinct from honeybees because they lack receiver bees (bees in the nest which receive pollen and nectar from incoming foragers during unloading) and are not capable of trophallaxis (the transfer of nectar from one bee to another).  They deposit collected nectar directly into the honey pots and don\u2019t share information of the quality of the resource with other bees through nectar transfer.  Another bee may sample the nectar brought into the nest, and if the colony is in need of food or the nectar is high quality she will likely go out foraging herself.  Other means of alerting passive bees to a potentially rewarding resource include releasing pheromone signals and increasing physical activity.  For information on communication methods in Honey Bees see Bee learning and communication.\n\n6. For the Bible Tells Me So is a 2007 American documentary film directed by Daniel G.

Stingless bees, sometimes called stingless honey bees or simply meliponines, are a large group of bees (about 500 species), comprising the tribe Meliponini (or subtribe Meliponina according to other authors).  They belong in the family Apidae, and are closely related to common honey bees, carpenter bees, orchid bees, and bumblebees. Meliponines have stingers, but they are highly reduced and cannot be used for defense, though these bees exhibit other defensive behaviors and mechanisms.  Meliponines are not the only type of \"stingless\" bee; all male bees and many female bees of several other families, such as Andrenidae, also cannot sting.\n\n9.

An integrating ADC is a type of analog-to-digital converter that converts an unknown input voltage into a digital representation through the use of an integrator.  In its basic implementation, the dual-slope converter, the unknown input voltage is applied to the input of the integrator and allowed to ramp for a fixed time period (the run-up period).  Then a known reference voltage of opposite polarity is applied to the integrator and is allowed to ramp until the integrator output returns to zero (the run-down period).  The input voltage is computed as a function of the reference voltage, the constant run-up time period, and the measured run-down time period.  The run-down time measurement is usually made in units of the converter's clock, so longer integration times allow for higher resolutions.  Likewise, the speed of the converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution.\n\n2. The Kingdom of Croatia (Latin: \"Regnum Croatiae\" ; Croatian: \"Hrvatsko kraljevstvo or Kraljevina Hrvatska\" ) entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, after a period of rule of kings from the Trpimirovi\u0107 and Svetoslavi\u0107 dynasties and a succession crisis following the death of king Demetrius Zvonimir.  With the coronation of King Coloman of Hungary as \"King of Croatia and Dalmatia\" in 1102 in Biograd, the realm passed to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty until 1301, when the (male) line of the dynasty died out.  Then, kings from the Capetian House of Anjou, who were also cognatic descendants of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d kings, ruled the kingdoms.  Later centuries were characterized by conflicts with the Mongols, who sacked Zagreb in 1242, competition with Venice for control over Dalmatian coastal cities, and internal warfare among Croatian nobility.  Various powerful nobles emerged in the time period, like Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir and Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107, that secured de facto independence for their realms.  The Ottoman incursion into Europe in the 16th century significantly reduced Croatian territories and left the country weak and divided.  After the death of Louis II in 1526 during the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs and a brief period of dynastic dispute, both crowns passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg, and the realms became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\n3.

Human population change is the difference between the size of the population from the beginning to the end of a certain time period.  In other words, population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time period.  As a whole,the world population has not been stable; it has increased manifold.  Due to this constant changing population, the subject of demographics, the statistics of how many people there are in a given population, was created.  Demography can also be defined as the study of populations, and the factors that cause the most amount of population growth or decline.  The main measurements of demography include: birth rates, death rates, sex ratios, life expectancy, and migration rates.  All of these measures are found by a series of surveys and censuses conducted over a time period in order to compare how the population is changing.  Other ways to measure population demographics include the use of historical maps, aerial photographs, and census statistics.  One of the reasons why demographers use statistics about population change is because of the social and demographic transformations that the world experiences; significant challenges for the government and businesses will take effect depending on the degree of the population change.\n\n7.

The economy of Macau has remained one of the most open in the world since its handover to China in 1999.  Apparel exports and gambling-related tourism are mainstays of the economy.

Tensions between people from Hong Kong and mainland China have developed since the handover of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997, and in particular since the late 2000s and early 2010s.  Various factors have contributed to the development of such tensions: these include a difference between the popular interpretation in Hong Kong of the \"One country, two systems\" constitutional principle as against the Chinese government's official interpretation; policies of the Hong Kong and central governments to encourage mainland visitors to Hong Kong; and changing economic environments in Hong Kong and mainland China.  Increasingly, these tensions have resulted in a rising sentiment in Hong Kong of hostility to \"mainlanders\" and resentment at a perceived trend towards assimilation and interference from the mainland and the central government, and at the same time a rising sentiment in mainland China of bewilderment and resentment at assertions that Hong Kong is, and should remain, different from the mainland in terms of political system, culture and language.\n\n7.

Increasingly, these tensions have resulted in a rising sentiment in Hong Kong of hostility to \"mainlanders\" and resentment at a perceived trend towards assimilation and interference from the mainland and the central government, and at the same time a rising sentiment in mainland China of bewilderment and resentment at assertions that Hong Kong is, and should remain, different from the mainland in terms of political system, culture and language.\n\nThe Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council is an administrative agency of the State Council of the People's Republic of China responsible for promoting cooperation and coordination of political, economic and cultural ties between Mainland China and the Chinese Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nLu Ping (Chinese: \u9b6f\u5e73; 27 September 1927 \u2013 3 May 2015) was a Chinese politician and diplomat.  He served as Head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.  He is best known as China's delegation head and main representative during negotiations for the transfer of sovereignties of Hong Kong and Macau from Britain and Portugal to the PRC and labelled the last governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten as \"Sinner of a Thousand Years\" () for his unilateral electoral reform proposals.\n\n", "chosen_titles": ["Overseas Chinese Affairs Office", "Economy of Macau", "Lu Ping", "Zhang Xiaoming", "Liao Hui (politician)", "Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office"], "correct": true}
{"id": 269, "question": "Hip scoring is a procedure used to determine the degree of an abnormal formation of the hip socket, that can cause crippling lameness and what other joint disorder? ", "answer": "arthritis", "pred": "arthritis of the joints", "subQuestions": ["What is hip scoring?", "What joint disorder can be caused by an abnormal formation of the hip socket?"], "original_context": "0. Hip resurfacing has been developed as a surgical alternative to total hip replacement (THR).  The procedure consists of placing a cobalt-chrome metal cap, which is hollow and shaped like a mushroom, over the head of the femur while a matching metal cup (similar to what is used with a THR) is placed in the acetabulum (pelvis socket), replacing the articulating surfaces of the patient's hip joint and removing very little bone compared to a THR.  When the patient moves the hip, the movement of the joint induces synovial fluid to flow between the hard metal bearing surfaces lubricating them when the components are placed in the correct position.  The surgeon's level of experience with hip resurfacing is most important; therefore, the selection of the right surgeon is crucial for a successful outcome.  Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.\n\n1. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, also called sacroiliac joint disorder, sacroiliac joint disease, sacroiliac joint syndrome or sacroiliac syndrome, or \"sacroilliac dysfunction and instability\", generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion.  It typically results in inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, and can be debilitating.\n\n2. Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes disease (LCPD) is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the ball of the femur called the femoral head.  Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing.  Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head.  The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket.  It is also referred to as idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown.\n\n3. Abnormality (or dysfunctional behavior), in the vivid sense of something deviating from the normal (c.f. Norm (social)) or differing from the typical (such as an aberration), is a subjectively defined behavioral characteristic, assigned to those with rare or dysfunctional conditions.  Behavior is considered abnormal when it is atypical, out of the ordinary, causes some kind of impairment, or consists of undesirable behavior.  Often what is abnormal, or what is not abnormal, is determined by an individual's culture.  The definition of what abnormal behavior is a contentious issue in abnormal psychology.  It is an assumption that abnormal behavior is a disorder that has a physical cause, specifically that it is related to the physical structure of the brain.  A diagnosis of a mental disorder describes a patient who has a medical condition and the doctor makes a judgment that the patient is exhibiting abnormal behavior.  The distinction being that mental disorders describe processes, not people.\n\n4. Hip scoring is a procedure used to determine the degree of hip dysplasia in dogs and other animals and reporting the findings in a standard way.\n\n5. Palatoplasty is a surgical procedure used to correct or reconstruct the palate in a person with a cleft palate.  The basic goals of the procedure are to close the abnormal opening between the nose and mouth, to help the patient develop normal speech, and to aid in swallowing, breathing and normal development of associated structures in the mouth.  Any person with any degree of a cleft palate is a candidate for palatoplasty.  The procedure is usually performed on infants.  The ideal age for the patient is between six and twelve months of age.  If the surgery is carried out much beyond three years of age, speech development may not be optimal.  80% of the time, development of the palate and speech is normal after only one procedure.\n\n6. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the development of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant.  HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis.  When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets.  If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.\n\n7. Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine.  It is a genetic disorder that typically follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from accumulation of free cystine in lysosomes, eventually leading to intracellular crystal formation throughout the body.  Cystinosis is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in the pediatric age group.  Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells in renal tubules is impaired, leading to abnormal amounts of carbohydrates and amino acids in the urine, excessive urination, and low blood levels of potassium and phosphates.\n\n8. In dogs, hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints.  It is a genetic (polygenic) trait that is affected by environmental factors.  It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds, and is the most common single cause of arthritis of the hips.\n\n9. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE or skiffy, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, SUFE or souffy, coxa vara adolescentium) is a medical term referring to a fracture through the growth plate (physis), which results in slippage of the overlying end of the femur (epiphysis).  Normally, the head of the femur, called the capital, should sit squarely on the femoral neck.  Abnormal movement along the growth plate results in the slip.  The femoral epiphysis remains in the acetabulum (hip socket), while the metaphysis (end of the femur) move in an anterior direction with external rotation.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes disease (LCPD) is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the ball of the femur called the femoral head.

Aggie Bonfire was a long-standing annual tradition at Texas A&M University as part of the college rivalry with the University of Texas at Austin.  For 90 years, Texas A&M students\u2014known as Aggies\u2014built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn.  Known to the Aggie community simply as \"Bonfire\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \"burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.\", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas.  The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual college football game.  Although early bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed the annual event became more organized.  Over the years the bonfire grew to an immense size, setting the world record in 1969.  In 1999, the Bonfire collapsed during construction, killing twelve people, eleven students and one former student, and injuring twenty-seven\u00a0others.  The accident led Texas A&M to declare a hiatus on an official Bonfire.  However, since 2002, a student-sponsored coalition has constructed an annual unsanctioned, off-campus \"Student Bonfire\" in the spirit of its predecessor.\n\n6. Venus and the Razorblades were a short-lived punk band.  The Los Angeles based new wave rock band was put together by Kim Fowley after he severed professional relations with The Runaways.

Prior to the late 20th century CE the language remained a total mystery even though many characters of the script appeared to be from the Greek alphabet.  Using Greek phonetic values of letters investigators of the 19th and 20th centuries were unable to make headway and classified the language as non-Indo-European.  Speculations multiplied, none very substantial.  Progress finally came as a result of rejecting the presumption of Greek phonetic values.\n\n2. Bimodal bilingualism refers to an individual or community's bilingual competency in at least one oral language and at least one sign language\u2014\"oral\" and \"sign\" are the modes to which \"bimodal\" refers.  A substantial number of bimodal bilinguals are Children of Deaf Adults or other hearing people who learn sign language for various reasons.  Deaf people as a group have their own sign language and culture, but invariably live within a larger hearing culture with its own oral language.  Thus, \"most deaf people are bilingual to some extent in [an oral] language in some form\".  In discussions of multilingualism in the United States, bimodal bilingualism and bimodal bilinguals have often not been mentioned or even considered, in part because American Sign Language, the predominant sign language used in the U.S., only began to be acknowledged as a natural language in the 1960s (In discussions of bimodal bilingualism in the U.S., the two languages involved are generally ASL and English).  However, bimodal bilinguals share many of the same traits as traditional bilinguals (those with competency in at least two \"spoken\" languages), as well as differing in some interesting ways, due to the unique characteristics of the Deaf community.\n\n3. \"A Brand New Day\", also known as \"Everybody Rejoice\", is a song from the 1975 Broadway musical \"The Wiz\" written by American R&B singer and songwriter Luther Vandross.  (In 1976 Vandross recorded a version of the song for his album \"Luther\", on Cotillion Records.)  In the play, the song is sung to celebrate because Dorothy has killed Evilene, the tyrannical Wicked Witch of the West.  Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow sing the song with the newly freed Winkies, who were ruled and enslaved by Evilene.  It was later featured in the 1978 film version, sung by cast members Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (credited as The Wiz Stars).  Given the all-Black cast of \"The Wiz\", the song's many references to freedom and new possibilities (especially as sung by African American characters who had just been freed from enslavement) certainly invoked the struggles and history of Blacks in America.  In the onscreen version of the song, Nipsey Russell can even be heard exclaiming \"Free at last!\" \u2014a reference to civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. (His impromptu addition to the song is not heard on the soundtrack album version, instead replaced by sung vocals by Diana Ross.)\n\n4. \"Ai no Uta\" (\u611b\u306e\u3046\u305f , Song of Love ) is an image song released in conjunction with the video game \"Pikmin\" for the Nintendo GameCube.  The song was only used in commercials for the game and does not appear in the game itself, and those commercials appeared only in Japan.  A small clip of the song though can be heard being sung by the Pikmin in \"Pikmin 2\", and the song is one of the default tracks available for the Distant Planet stage in \"Super Smash Bros.  Brawl\" (along with a new, French language version).  The song is sung by the virtual group Strawberry Flower, who also sang the theme song for \"Pikmin 2\".  The title of the song translates to \"Song of Love,\" so named because the song expounds on the emotions the Pikmin feel in relation to their involvement in the game.\n\n5. Om Jai Jagdish Harey (Hindi: \u0950 \u091c\u092f \u091c\u0917\u0926\u0940\u0936 \u0939\u0930\u0947 ) is a Hindu religious song for the deity Vishnu, however it also considered to be a monotheistic song.  Although the religious hymn is a Hindi language composition, it is widely sung by many Hindus within the Indian Diaspora, regardless of their native language.  The prayer is sung by the entire congregation at the time of Aarti, a form of Hindu worship.\n\n6. Shuaib (] ), or Shu\u02bfayb, or Shoaib (Arabic: \u0634\u0639\u064a\u0628\u200e \u200e \"\u0161u\u02bfayb\"; meaning \"who shows the right path\"), was an ancient Midianite Prophet, sometimes identified with the Biblical Jethro (though Islam attributes to him many deeds not mentioned in the Bible).  He is mentioned in the Quran a total of 11 times.  He is believed to have lived after Abraham, and Muslims believe that he was sent as a prophet to a community: the Midianites also known as the People of the Tree since they used to worship a large tree.  To the people, Shu\u02bfayb proclaimed the faith of Islam and warned the people to end their fraudulent ways.  When they did not repent, God destroyed the community.  Shu\u02bfayb is understood by Muslims to have been one of the few Arabian prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an, the others being Saleh, Hud, and prophet Muhammad.  It is said that he was known by early Muslims as \"the eloquent preacher amongst the prophets\", because he was, according to tradition, granted talent and eloquence in his language.\n\n7. Caleno custure me (also spelled Calin o custure me) is the title of a song mentioned in Shakespeare's Henry V (IV,4).  The context is on a Hundred years war battlefield, where an English soldier cannot understand his French captive and intending to answer in similar gibberish pronounces the title of the song.\n\n8. Gnommish is the \"fairy language\" used in the \"Artemis Fowl\" series by Eoin Colfer.  It is not actually a language at all, but the English language encoded into a letter-substitution cipher where each symbol represents a letter.  Lines of translatable Gnommish run along the bottoms of books one, two, four, five and six.  However, in book one of the series, it is mentioned that one of the symbols was comparable to the Egyptian Anubis symbol.  It is also mentioned that Gnommish is a mix of symbolic and alphabetic letters, running in spirals (but since reading in spirals gives most fairies migraines, most modern fairy script is arranged in horizontal lines).\n\n9.

The United States presidential election of 1824 was the tenth quadrennial presidential election, held from Tuesday, October 26, to Thursday, December 2, 1824.  John Quincy Adams was elected President on February 9, 1825.  The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote.  It was also the first U.S. presidential election where the popular vote was recorded, and the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n\n1. The 2016 Democratic National Convention was a presidential nominating convention, held at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from July 25 through to July 28, 2016.  The convention gathered delegates of the Democratic Party, the majority of them elected through a preceding series of primaries and caucuses, to nominate a candidate for president and vice president in the 2016 United States presidential election.  Former U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was chosen as the party's nominee for president by a 59.67% majority of delegates present at the convention roll call, defeating primary rival Senator Bernie Sanders, who received 39.16% of votes from delegates, and becoming the first female candidate to be formally nominated for presidential by a major political party in the United States.  Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, was confirmed by delegates as the party's nominee for vice president by acclamation.\n\n2. The United States presidential election of 1964 was the 45th quadrennial presidential election.  It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964.  Democratic candidate and incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had come to office less than a year earlier following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy.  Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy\u2019s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe\u2019s re-election in 1820.  It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes.  No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson\u2019s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin.\n\n3. The Stop Trump movement, also called the anti-Trump, Dump Trump, or Never Trump movement, was the informal name for the effort on the part of some Republicans and other prominent conservatives to prevent front-runner and now President of the United States Donald Trump from obtaining the Republican Party presidential nomination, and, following his nomination, the presidency, for the 2016 United States presidential election.  Although Trump's campaign drew a substantial amount of criticism, he was ultimately elected in November 2016 and sworn in as president on January 20, 2017.\n\n4. Jill Ellen Stein (born May 14, 1950) is an American physician, activist, and politician.  She was the Green Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections.  She was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010.\n\n5. Following Republican nominee Donald Trump's presumed electoral college victory in the United States presidential election of 2016, a group of computer scientists, cyber security experts, and election monitors raised concerns about the integrity of the election results.  They urged the campaign staff of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who had conceded the campaign on November 9, to petition for a recount in three key states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  When the Clinton campaign declined to file for recounts, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein agreed to spearhead the recount effort on November 23, on the grounds that unspecified \"anomalies\" may have affected the election's outcome.  The Clinton team subsequently pledged to support the recount efforts \"in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\"  President-elect Trump and his supporters filed legal motions in all three states to prevent the recounts.  Two other states were the subject of recount bids that were separate from Stein's efforts in the Rust Belt states: American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente filed for a partial recount in Nevada on November 30, and three Florida citizens filed for a complete hand recount in their state on December 6.\n\n6. The 2016 United States presidential election debates were a series of debates held for the 2016 U.S. presidential general election.  The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization formed in 1987, organized three debates among the major presidential candidates.  The first presidential debate for the 2016 election took place on September 26, 2016, and set the record as the most-watched debate in American history, with 84 million viewers.  The only vice-presidential debate was held on October 4.  The second presidential debate took place on October 9, and the final debate took place on October 19.  All CPD debates occurred from approximately 9\u00a0p.m. to 10:30\u00a0p.m. EDT (6\u00a0p.m. to 7:30\u00a0p.m. PDT).\n\n7. The 2016 New York State Legislature Primary Elections took place on September 13, 2016 and the general election was held on November 8, 2016.  All 150 members of the New York State Assembly and all 63 seats of the New York State Senate were up for election.  There are no term limited members as New York does not have term limits for positions at the state level.  Members of the Assembly and the State Senate serve two year terms.  The State Senate was heavily contested as the Democrats and Republicans both had 31 seats with the Republicans only controlling the Senate through a coalition deal with Democratic Senator Simcha Felder and the Independent Democratic Conference.  The 2016 United States presidential election also occurred on the same date as the general election.\n\n8. Alyson Kennedy (born June 11, 1950) is an American activist, a member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 United States presidential election.  She was the party's candidate for Vice President in the 2008 United States presidential election.  The ticket campaigned for young voters especially.  At the head of the ticket were two different candidates, Roger Calero and James Harris; Harris was an alternate in some states because Calero was Constitutionally ineligible because he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States (holding a green card), and not a US Citizen.  They were the first pair to qualify for the ballot in Louisiana Calero/Kennedy won 5,127 votes and Harris/Kennedy 2,424.\n\n9. The Missouri bellwether is a political phenomenon that notes that the state of Missouri voted for the winner in all but three U.S. Presidential election from 1904 to 2016 (the exceptions are 1956, 2008 and 2012).  While states like Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, and New Mexico have been arguably stronger indicators of political trends in recent years, Missouri was a consistent swing state throughout the 20th century.  Nevada has voted for the winner of every presidential election from United States presidential election, 1912 to the present, excluding United States presidential election, 1976 and United States presidential election, 2016, perhaps making it the new bellwether state.  Prior to the 2008 elections, Lincoln County, Missouri was said to be the only bellwether county in a bellwether state.  Missouri is also considered a bellwether of U.S. views on hot-button social issues such as stem cell research, gay rights, and school vouchers.  Some economists also consider the state a bellwether for economic trends such as consumer confidence and unemployment.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Following Republican nominee Donald Trump's presumed electoral college victory in the United States presidential election of 2016, a group of computer scientists, cyber security experts, and election monitors raised concerns about the integrity of the election results.

Helsinki had been earlier selected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to World War II.  It is the northernmost city at which a summer Olympic Games have been held.  These were the first games to be held in a non-Indo-European language speaking country.  It was also the Olympic Games at which the most number of world records were broken until surpassed by the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

In total, 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports.  This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not \"Olympic\".

It was the first Olympic Games to take place in twelve years, due to the Second World War (and was known informally as \"The Austerity Games\" - largely due to countries having to bring their own food due to shortages in Britain), with London being chosen as the host city in March 1946.  London had previously hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics, and was due to have hosted the event in 1944.  A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men and 385 women, in 19 sport disciplines.  Following the Second World War, Germany and Japan remained under military occupation and had not yet formed their National Olympic Committee, and so were not invited.  The only major Axis power to take part in the Games was Italy.  The Soviet Union also did not form a National Olympic Committee and was ineligible to be invited to compete.  However, they did send observers and competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics.

Fraser (30 June 1913 \u2013 27 November 1988) was an American Trotskyist and the principal theoretician of the doctrine of revolutionary integrationism in the 1950s within the Socialist Workers Party (US), against George Breitman's advocacy of support for black nationalism.  He joined the Trotskyist movement in 1934, and was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in the US.  He made a study of the black question in the late 1940s, after the Party began to lose hundreds of black recruits.  This was due not only to the rise of McCarthyist repression of the SWP, but also, of the party's burgeoning opportunism on the question of black nationalism.  Informally, the leadership had even begun discouraging white and black members from forming interracial couples.\n\n7. Transformative social change is a philosophical, practical and strategic process to affect revolutionary change within society, i.e., social transformation.  It is effectively a systems approach applied to broad-based social change and social justice efforts to catalyze sociocultural, socioeconomic and political revolution.  In seeking to integrate and then politicize personal development and social development as an overarching approach to social change at multiple levels, addressing a wide range of issues, using holistic, nonviolent methods, it may be best classified as a new social movement.  Rather than focus on particular issue(s), it seeks to impact the culture of left of center social movement and organizing work.  However, by considering the dismantling of and liberation from oppressive systems, including economic, as core to its goal, it defies even definitions put forth for new social movements.  As a comprehensive approach to progressive social change, it seeks distinguishes to itself from the \"ordinary\" change of conventional social change, social justice and their respective organizing practices by placing emphasis on personal, organizational and social systemic change that cannot be undone, or \"deep change\".\n\n8.
