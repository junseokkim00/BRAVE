The Douro Wine Company (also known as the General Company of Agriculture of the Wines of the Upper Douro and in Portuguese Companhia Geral da Agricultura e Vinhos do Alto Douro) was a government oversight organization established by the Portuguese Prime Minister Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal to regulate the trade and production of Port wine.  Established in 1756, one of the first official duties of the company was the delineation of the boundaries of the Douro wine region.  This act essentially made the Douro the world's first regional appellation.  While the boundaries of the Chianti and Tokaji wine regions were outlined in 1716 and 1737, respectively, neither of these regions were \"technically\" appellations in the sense of being subjected to continued government control and regulations.  Under their charter, Pombal invested an immense amount of control in the Douro Wine Company to regulate all exports of Port, set production quantities limits, fix maximum and minimum prices for grapes and to serve as sole arbitrator in any disputes between vine growers and Port shippers.  In 1761, the company was further granted a monopoly on the sale of brandy which was used in the fortification process of Port winemaking.  The Douro Wine Company continued to operate to 1833 (and was briefly revived from 1843 and 1853).  Today, many of it functions have been deregulated with the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto or (Port and Douro Wines Institute) being the official regulating body of Port wine and Douro table wine production.\n\n2. According to the Method of Punctuation of the Plots of Land of Vineyards of the Region of Douro (decree n\u00ba 413/2001), there were 30 recommended and 82 permitted grape varieties in Port wine production.  The quality and characteristics of each grape varies with the classification of grape varieties making a distinction between \"Very Good\", \"Good\", \"Average\", \"Mediocre\" and \"Bad\" quality grapes.  But this classification is actually in revaluation based on the technical and scientific data of the CEVD (Center of Wine Studies of Douro).  The six most widely used grapes for red Port wine are Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca, Touriga Nacional, Tinto C\u00e3o and Tinta Amarela.\n\n3. Port wine (also known as vinho do Porto, ] , Porto, and usually simply port) is a Portuguese fortified wine produced exclusively in the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal.  It is typically a sweet, red wine, often served as a dessert wine, though it also comes in dry, semi-dry, and white varieties.  Fortified wines in the style of port are also produced outside Portugal, most notably in Australia, France, South Africa, Canada, India, Argentina, and the United States.  Under European Union Protected Designation of Origin guidelines, only the product from Portugal may be labelled as \"port\" or \"Porto\".  In the United States, wines labelled \"port\" may come from anywhere in the world, while the names \"Oporto\", \"Porto\", and \"Vinho do Porto\" have been recognised as foreign, non-generic names for Port wines originating in Portugal.\n\n4. The Bananarita is a variation of a margarita with a banana liquor, but served in a cocktail glass (on the rocks).\n\n5. Schilcher is a wine produced solely in the Austrian region of Western Styria (\"Weststeiermark\") and Southern Burgenland (S\u00fcdburgenland), in the districts of Deutschlandsberg and Voitsberg, sharing a border with Slovenia and Carinthia to the south and west.  The wine growing area is the smallest in Europe.  The Schilcher wine itself is a distinct ros\u00e9 made from the indigenous Blauer Wildbacher grape.  The colour ranges from a light onion tinge to a deep ruby.  The grape was once a wild variety which was said to contain alcohol compounds which, in turn, allegedly would induce wild inebriation, hence its colloquial name \"Rabiatperle\" - rabid pearl.  The name Schilcher originates from the Middle High German word \"schillern\" meaning to radiate with colour.\n\n6. Symington Family Estates is a wine company and Port wine house in Portugal, which owns and operates several vineyards and wineries and owns several brands of Port, Madeira wine and Douro DOC wines, including some of the oldest and most well-known Port and Madeira brands.  With their extensive vineyard holdings and many Port brands, the Symingtons are often described as being a \"Port empire\".\n\n7. Vintage, in winemaking, is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished product (see Harvest (wine)).  A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year.  In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years.  From this tradition, a common, though incorrect, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.\n\n8. Akadama (\u8d64\u7389 ) , originally Akadama port wine is a Japanese sweet red wine created in 1907 by Shinjiro Torii, the founder of Suntory.  Akadama sweet wine remains popular amongst all generations and is still found in stores across Japan today.  Just like Sherry and Madeira wine, Akadama port wine is a Fortified wine; it is sweeter than the general wines.\n\n9. Port wine cheese is an orange- and red-colored cheese or cheese spread that is heavily dosed with alcoholic port wine as it is made.  It is typically used as a cheese spread on foods such as crackers.  It can be rolled into a cylindrical shape or into a ball, and is sometimes covered in crushed walnuts.  Port wine cheese is a mass-produced product in the United States, and several brands are purveyed to American consumers.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Port wine (also known as vinho do Porto, ] , Porto, and usually simply port) is a Portuguese fortified wine produced exclusively in the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal.

Agnes von Hohenstaufen is an opera in three acts by the Italian composer Gaspare Spontini.  The German libretto is by Ernst Benjamin Salomo Raupach.  It was first staged at the K\u00f6nigliches Opernhaus, Berlin, on 12 June 1829.  Raupach categorised \"Agnes von Hohenstaufen\" as a \"historical-romantic\" opera and it is one of a number of German works of the time set in the Middle Ages (others include Weber's \"Euryanthe\", Wagner's \"Tannh\u00e4user\" and \"Lohengrin\" and Schumann's \"Genoveva\").  \"Agnes\" also contains many of the features that would be characteristic of French Grand Opera.  Spontini substantially reworked the piece for a revival in 1837.\n\n1. Pauline Duchambge n\u00e9e de Montet (1778 \u2013 23 April 1858) was a French Creole pianist, singer, and composer.  Duchambdge (Montet) was born in Martinique, West Indies and was the daughter of a noble family.  She was taken to Paris, where she received a convent education and studied the piano from composer and author Jean Baptiste Desormery, son of the famous comic opera actor and composer L\u00e9opold-Bastien Desormery.  Pauline composed and performed as a singer and a pianist.  She studied harmony and composition with Daniel Auber and with Luigi Cherubini, who wrote several compositions for her.  She also studied piano and composition with Jan Ladislav Dussek.  Pauline left the convent in 1792 and married Baron Duchambge in 1796.  In 1798 at the age of 20, she lost both her parents and with them the family fortune.  Soon afterwards she was later divorced.  It was after these events that Duchamge musical education began in earnest.  She studied church music with Jan Dussek, Luigi Cherubini and D.F.E Auber.  In 1815, Duchambge met the French poet and novelist, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore beginning a lifelong friendship and collaboration.  Their friendship is documented by a lengthy correspondence and a number of songs by Duchambge on Debordes-Valmore\u2019s texts including L\u2019adieu tout bas, La fianc\u00e9e del marin, Je pense \u00e0 lui, La jeune Ch\u00e2telaine, R\u00eave du mousse, La sinc\u00e8re and La valse et l\u2019automne.  Duchambge also composed music to texts and romances of other female authors such as Mme Amble Tastu and Mme Emile De Girardin.  Pauline Duchambge wrote over three hundred romances, a very popular genre in the nineteenth century.  Auber deposited three hundred of Duchambge\u2019s songs in the Biblioth\u00e8que du Conservatoire in Paris.  Eleven of Duchambge's individual songs and albums of songs were published between 1827 and 1841 by some of the leading Parisian publishers: Jean Antoine Meissonnier, Jacques-Joseph Frey, A. Petibon, and Ignace Pleyel.  Her works reached a German audience through the Berlin publisher Maurice Schlesinger and the Schott firm in Mainz.  In addition to songs, Duchambge wrote a few piano pieces.  Duchambge had a difficult life, struggling with poverty, delicate health, and the disenchantments of love; her music expresses her emotions.  She commented: \"Love, it is life!  but a life full of troubles, illusions, deceptions, repentance, discouragements\u2026. \"\n\n2. Gaspare Luigi Pacifico Spontini (14 November 177424 January 1851) was an Italian opera composer and conductor.\n\n3. Maiolati Spontini is a \"comune\" (municipality) in the Province of Ancona in the Italian region Marche, located about 35 km southwest of Ancona.  It is the birthplace of musician Gaspare Spontini, whose name has been conjoined with the commune's ancient name, Maiolati.\n\n4. Milton is an op\u00e9ra comique in one act by Gaspare Spontini.  The French libretto, by Victor-Joseph \u00c9tienne de Jouy and Armand-Michel Dieulafoy, is based on the life of the English poet John Milton.  \"Milton\" was first performed on 27 November 1804 by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Salle Feydeau in Paris .  It was Spontini's first major success in France.  The composer planned a reworked version for performances in Germany, under the title \"Das verlorene Paradies\" (\"Paradise Lost\"), but in the event it was never staged.\n\n5. Olimpie (also spelled Olympie) is an opera in three acts by Gaspare Spontini.  The French libretto, by Armand-Michel Dieulafoy and Charles Brifaut (1781\u20131857), is based on the play of the same name by Voltaire (1761).  \"Olimpie\" was first performed on 22 December 1819 by the Paris Op\u00e9ra at the Salle Montansier.  When sung in Italian or German, it is usually given the title Olimpia.\n\n6. Luigi Cherubini (] ; 8 or 14 September 1760 \u2013 15 March 1842) was an Italian composer who spent most of his working life in France.  His most significant compositions are operas and sacred music.  Beethoven regarded Cherubini as the greatest of his contemporaries.\n\n7. La vestale (\"The Vestal Virgin\") is an opera composed by Gaspare Spontini to a French libretto by \u00c9tienne de Jouy.  It takes the form of a \"trag\u00e9die lyrique\" in three acts.  It was first performed on 15 December 1807 by the Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale de Musique (Paris Opera) at the Salle Montansier, and is regarded as Spontini's masterpiece.  The musical style shows the influence of Gluck and looks forwards to the works of Berlioz, Wagner and French Grand Opera.\n\n8. Gaspare Spontini (1774\u20131851) wrote operas from the last decade of the 18th century to the third decade of the 19th century.\n\n9.

Cliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff.  He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach.  He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees.  Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts.  Some considered him to be dangerously provocative.  He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.\n\n2. Isaiah Stillman (1793\u201315 April 1861) was an American Cavalry Major who led the Illinois militia in the first armed confrontation of the Black Hawk War against Black Hawk's Sauk Indian Band.

Leonis Adobe, built in 1844, is one of the oldest surviving private residences in Los Angeles County and one of the oldest surviving buildings in the San Fernando Valley.  Located in what is now Calabasas, California, the adobe was occupied by the wealthy rancher Miguel Leonis (October 20, 1824 - September 20, 1889) until his death.  Following Leonis' death, the property was the subject of a legal dispute between his common law wife Espiritu Chijulla (1836 - May 10, 1906), heirs, and a daughter born out of wedlock; the dispute lasted more than 15 years in the courts.  In 1961, the adobe had fallen victim to vandalism, and its owner applied for a permit to raze the structure and erect a supermarket in its place.  Preservationists succeeded in having the adobe declared a Historic-Cultural Landmark (the first structure in Los Angeles receiving the designation) in 1962.\n\n4. Julio Ren\u00e9 Alvarado Ruano (2002? -20 April 2016) was a fourteen-year-old Guatemalan male that was killed in the Belize\u2013Guatemala adjacency zone during an armed confrontation between the Belize Defence Force, Belizean park rangers and Guatemalan farmers.  The incident raised tensions between Belize and Guatemala, who have an ongoing border dispute since 1821.  Belizean officials maintain that the Belize Defence Force acted in self-defence.  However, the Guatemalan government claims the incident was a deliberate attack carried out by Belize's military.  After the incident, the Organisation of American States agreed to investigate the death of Julio Alvarado at the request of both countries.\n\n5.

Sivagnanam (Ma.  Po.  Si) in Tamil Nadu.  It was established as an association in 1946.  Its goals were to pressurize the Indian National Congress Government of the Madras Presidency to increase the use of Tamil in administration and education, to create an autonomous Tamil state out of a composite Madras Presidency and to soften the pro-Hindi stance of the Congress.  The association was allied with the Congress during 1946-54 and worked against the Dravidian Movement.  However, it grew closer to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) over time.  During 1946-54, Sivagnanam was a member of the Congress.  He left the Congress in 1954 and turned the Tamil Arasu Kazhagam into an independent political party.  During 1957-60, it was involved in various protests over the drawing of state boundaries when Andhra Pradesh split from the composite Madras State.  It eventually became a part of DMK's electoral alliance in the 1967 assembly elections.  It was also involved in the movements to change the name of the state from Madras State to Tamil Nadu and to promote the use of Tamil over Sanskrit for conducting \"Archanai\" (Offerings to God) in Hindu temples.  In the 1967 elections, two candidates of the party (including Sivagnanam) were elected to the assembly contesting under DMK's \"Rising Sun\" Symbol.  The party was also an DMK ally in the 1971 assembly elections.  In 1972, it opposed the DMK chief minister M. Karunanidhi's decision to scrap prohibition laws and switched its allegiance to DMK's splinter group - the M. G. Ramachandran led Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK).  The party did not directly contest in elections after 1971 and Sivagnanam was nominated to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council in 1972.  He remained as the member of the legislative council till its disbandment in 1986.  The party stopped functioning after Sivagnanam's death in 1995.\n\n2.

The Lotus 56 was a gas turbine-powered four-wheel driven racing car, designed by Maurice Philippe as Team Lotus' 1968 STP-backed entry in the Indianapolis 500, replacing the successful Lotus 38 and the 1967 STP-Paxton Turbocar.  The 4WD concept was also used in the 1969 Lotus 63 F1 car, and the wedge shape became a prominent feature of the world championships winning Lotus 72.  As Lotus 56B, a modified version designed by Maurice Philippe and Colin Chapman, the gas turbine car returned in Gold Leaf colours at a few Formula One events.\n\n1. The Lotus 30 was a racing automobile, Colin Chapman's first attempt at a large displacement sports car racing machine following the success of the smaller Lotus 19 and Lotus 23.  In a way as a further development of the final Lotus 19 called Lotus 19B, which had a Ford V8 engine installed in place of Coventry Climax FPF, it was designed by Colin Chapman and Martin Wade, and built in 1964.  Lotus 30 was raced in British races such as Guards Trophy, international races such as Nassau Speed Week that allowed FIA Group 4 \"Sports Car\" class of racing machines, and more importantly, in Can Am series.  These were before the recognition and creation of Group 5, 6 and 7 categories by FIA in 1966.  This explains why Lotus 30 and 40 (the latter was built in 1965) came originally equipped with headlights, tail lights and a windshield wiper.\n\n2. The Lotus 91 was a car used by the English team Lotus in the 1982 Formula One season, designed by Colin Chapman, Martin Ogilvie and Tony Rudd.  After several uncompetitive seasons with experimental or mediocre cars, Colin Chapman went back to basics and designed the graceful Lotus 91, based in part on the Williams FW07 and Lotus' own 88 design.  Powered by the Ford Cosworth DFV, and using a standard Hewland gearbox, the 91 was uncomplicated and easy to maintain.  Following Brabham's lead, the new car was the first Lotus chassis to use carbon brakes, improving braking performance considerably.\n\n3. The Lotus 48 was a Formula 2 racing car designed by Colin Chapman and powered by a 1600 cc Cosworth FVA engine.  Four cars were built, two of which were written off in accidents.  Team Lotus ran the 48 in Formula Two in 1967 and 1968, although its first appearance was at the 1967 Australian Grand Prix, at that time a round of the Tasman Series.  In 1969, the remaining two cars were purchased by Team Ireland, one of which was driven by John Watson in that year's B.A.R.C. \"200\" F2 event at Thruxton.\n\n4.

Walter Hancock (16 June 1799 \u2013 14 May 1852) was an English inventor of the Victorian period.  He is chiefly remembered for his steam-powered road vehicles, but also received a patent for preparing and cutting natural rubber into sheets.  He was the younger brother of Thomas Hancock, the inventor of rubber mastication who is also claimed by some to be the inventor of rubber vulcanization.\n\n6. The Lotus 76 was a Formula One car designed by Colin Chapman, Tony Rudd and Ralph Bellamy for the 1974 Formula One season.  The car was intended to be a more advanced version of the Lotus 72, powered by the Ford Cosworth DFV and featuring modified aerodynamics, a lighter chassis, longer wheelbase and a narrower, lower monocoque.  The car also featured a bi-plane rear wing, designed to increase rear downforce and stability.  Additionally it had an electronically operated clutch, which was the precursor to the modern semi automatic gearboxes seen on today's F1 cars, with the control mounted into the gearstick which theoretically speeded up gearchanges.  The Lotus 76 was seen as a major technological breakthrough by Team Lotus.  Outwardly, the car looked sleek and impressive.  Internally, the suspension set up and inboard brake positioning were carried over from the Lotus 72.  The car's development had been paid for by title sponsor John Player Special, so the 76 was given the chassis number 'John Player Special Mk I.'\n\n7. The Lotus 16 was the second single-seat racing car designed by Colin Chapman, and was built by his Lotus Cars manufacturing company for the Team Lotus racing squad.  The Lotus 16 was constructed to compete in both the Formula One and Formula Two categories, and was the first Lotus car to be constructed for Formula One competition.  Its design carried over many technological features of the first Lotus single-seater, the Lotus 12, as well as incorporating ideas which Chapman had been developing while working on the Vanwall racing cars.  Indeed, such was the visual similarity between the Vanwall and Lotus 16 designs that the Lotus was often dubbed the \"\"mini Vanwall\"\" by the contemporary motor sport press.  Although the Lotus 16 only scored five Formula One World Championship points in the three seasons during which it was used, its raw pace pointed the way for its more successful successors, the Lotus 18 and 21.\n\n8.

Tropical Storm Danielle was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season.  The fourth storm of the season, Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew.  It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina.  The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents.  Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula.  The storm quickly dissipated over land.\n\n1. Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic hurricane in October 2000 that caused extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize.  It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the that year's Atlantic hurricane season.  Keith developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September\u00a028.  The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day.  As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September\u00a030.  Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category\u00a04 hurricane less than 24\u00a0hours later.  Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction.  By late on October\u00a02, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane.  It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day.  While moving inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October\u00a04.  Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day.  By late on October\u00a05, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane.  The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24\u00a0hours after landfall.\n\n2. The effects of Hurricane Andrew in the Bahamas included three direct fatalities and $250\u00a0million (1992\u00a0USD) in damage.  Forming from a tropical wave on August\u00a016, Andrew remained weak until rapidly intensifying on August\u00a022, and late on August\u00a023 it made its first landfall in The Bahamas on Eleuthera as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph); early the next day Hurricane Andrew passed through the southern Berry Islands with winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph).  The hurricane later made a devastating landfall in southern Florida, and after striking southern Louisiana it dissipated over the eastern United States.  Andrew was the first major hurricane to affect the nation since Hurricane Betsy in 1965.  It caused $250\u00a0million in damage (1965\u00a0USD, $384\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD), with damage heaviest on Eleuthera and Cat Cay.  Four deaths occurred due to the storm, of which one was indirectly related to the hurricane.\n\n3. Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that struck the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state.  It was the strongest in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005.  Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h).  Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations.  In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.\n\n4. Tropical Storm Jerry was a short-lived tropical storm that formed in the latter half of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season.  Forming as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados, Jerry intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear.  After reaching its peak of 50 mph (80\u00a0km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8.  Shortly after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, moderate upper-level wind shear affected Jerry's upper-level outflow, and the cyclone weakened to a depression shortly afterwards.  Deterioration in organization continued, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico.  Jerry caused minimal effects in the Lesser Antilles.\n\n5. Tropical Storm Jerry was a tropical storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season.  Jerry, the tenth tropical storm of the season, formed from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast in early August, which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month, before striking Florida in the latter part of the month.  Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall.  The rainfall it produced, amounting to over 12 in in several locations across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, was responsible for $40 million (2005 USD) in damage and 6 deaths.  At the time, Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record, until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it.  Tropical Storm Jerry was also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\n6. Hurricane Gordon caused minor damage in the Eastern United States.  The seventh named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Gordon developed in the extreme western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave on September\u00a014.  Shortly thereafter, the depression moved inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and later emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a015.  The depression began to quickly organize, and by early on September\u00a016, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon.  After becoming a tropical storm, Gordon continued to intensify and was reclassified as a hurricane about 24\u00a0hours later; eventually, the storm peaked as an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a01 hurricane.  However, southwesterly upper-level winds caused Gordon to weaken as it approached land, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm by late on September\u00a017.  At 0300\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, Gordon made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida as a strong tropical storm.  After moving inland, Gordon rapidly weakened and had deteriorated to tropical depression status by nine hours later.  Later that day, Gordon merged with a frontal boundary while centered over Georgia.\n\n7. Hurricane Jerry caused minor damage in Texas and flash flooding in Kentucky and Virginia in October\u00a01989.  The fourteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm of the season, Jerry developed from a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche on October\u00a012.  Initially a tropical depression, the system moved north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on the following day.  Jerry continuously deepened until October\u00a014 and then maintained intensity while curving northeastward and briefly decelerating.  Later that day, the storm re-curved north-northwestward.  Jerry began to intensify on October\u00a015 and soon became a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.  Early on October\u00a016, Jerry made landfall on Galveston Island, Texas with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).  Less than six hours later, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression shortly thereafter.  Late on October\u00a016, Jerry was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over southwestern Arkansas.\n\n8. Tropical Storm Lidia was a deadly, destructive tropical cyclone that occurred during the 1981 Pacific hurricane season.  It resulted in more casualties and caused greater damage than Hurricane Norma, which took place later that season.  On October 6, a tropical depression formed and strengthened into a tropical storm six hours later.  Lidia brushed the Gulf of California coast of Baja California Sur and made landfall just south of Los Mochis in Sinaloa on October 8.  Tropical Storm Lidia rapidly weakened and dissipated the same day.  Lidia killed at least 73 people and caused at least $80 million (1981 USD) which is equivalent to $193 million (2010 USD) in damage.  It inflicted heavy rain and flooding throughout parts of northwestern Mexico, especially Sinaloa.\n\n9. Hurricane Georges was a powerful and long-lived Cape Verde-type Category 4 hurricane which caused severe destruction as it traversed the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in September 1998, making seven landfalls along its path.  Georges was the seventh tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season.  It became the second most destructive storm of the season after Hurricane Mitch, the costliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the deadliest since Hurricane Gordon in 1994.  Georges killed 604\u00a0people, mainly on the island of Hispaniola, and caused extensive damage resulting at just under $10\u00a0billion (1998 US dollars, equivalent to $ \u00a0billion in 2016 ) in damages mostly in St. Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Tropical Storm Jerry was a tropical storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season.

Marine terraces found in the Gulf Coastal Lowlands include the Silver Bluff [1 ft to 10 ft above mean sea level (msl)], Pamlico [8 ft to 25 ft above msl], Talbot [25 ft to 42 ft above msl], Penholoway [42 ft to 72 ft above msl] and Wicomico [70 ft to 100 ft above msl] terraces.\n\n2. Lake Whittlesey was a proglacial lake that was an ancestor of present-day Lake Erie.  It formed about 14,000 years ago.  As the Erie Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier retreated at the end of the last ice age, it left melt-water in a previously-existing depression area that was the valley of an eastward-flowing river known as the Erigan River that probably emptied into the Atlantic Ocean following the route of today's Saint Lawrence River.  The lake stood at 735 ft to 740 ft above sea level.  The remanent beach is not horizontal as there is a \u2018hinge line\u2019 southwest of a line from Ashtabula, Ohio, through the middle part of Lake St. Clair.  The hinge line is where the horizontal beaches of the lake have been warped upwards towards the north by the isostatic rebound as the weight of the ice sheet was removed from the land.  The rise is 60 ft north into Michigan and the Ubly outlet.  The current altitude of the outlet is 800 ft above sea level.  Where the outlet entered the Second Lake Saginaw at Cass City the elevation is 740 ft above sea level.\n\n3. M\u0101hukona is a submerged shield volcano on the northwestern flank of the Island of Hawai\u02bb i.  A drowned coral reef at about 3,770 feet (-1,150 m) below sea level and a major break in slope at about 4,400 feet (-1,340 m) below sea level represent old shorelines.  The summit of the shield volcano was once 800 feet (250 m) above sea level.  It has now subsided below sea level.  A roughly circular caldera marks the summit of M\u0101hukona.  A prominent rift zone extends to the west.  A second rift zone probably extended to the east but has been buried by younger volcanoes.  The main shield-building stage of volcanism ended about 470,000 years ago.  The summit of the shield volcano subsided below sea level between 435,000 and 365,000 years ago.\n\n4. Alocasia robusta is a gigantic herb of the aroid family (Araceae) which is endemic to the island of Borneo.  The plant is a rosette herb consisting of several leaves with a sagitate (arrowhead shaped) lamina or blade up to 12 ft long by 8 ft wide, borne on very stout petioles or stalks up to 12 ft in length.  This species was unknown to science prior to 1967.  The plant is usually trunkless.\n\n5. Sebago Lake is the deepest and second largest lake in the U.S. state of Maine.  The lake is 316 ft deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of 101 ft , covers about 45 sqmi in surface area, has a length of 12 mi and a shoreline length of 105 mi .  The surface is around 270 ft above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level.  It is located in Cumberland County, Maine, and bordered by the towns of Casco, Naples, Raymond, Sebago, Standish and Windham.  The seasonally occupied town of Frye Island is on an island in the lake.\n\n6. The 1964 Alaskan earthquake, also known as the Great Alaskan earthquake and Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 5:36 PM AST on Good Friday, March 27.  Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 139 deaths.\n\n7. Elliott Key is the northernmost of the true Florida Keys (those 'keys' which are ancient coral reefs lifted above the present sea level), and the largest key north of Key Largo.  It is located entirely within Biscayne National Park, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, east of Homestead, Florida.  It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Biscayne Bay to the west, Sands Key (across Sands Cut) to the north and Old Rhodes Key (across Caesar Creek) to the south.  Adams Key is just west of the southern end of Elliott Key.  Elliott Key is about seven miles (11\u00a0km) long.  Its maximum width is about 2500 ft near the north end and its average width is less than 2000 ft .  The higher elevations on the island range from 6 to 8 ft above sea level and occur generally along an unimproved road that runs longitudinally through the center of the island.  The average elevation is about 3 ft above sea level.  The key is accessible only by boat.  Elliot Key has a National Park Service campground, but is otherwise uninhabited.\n\n8. Tidal flooding, also known as sunny day flooding or nuisance flooding, is the temporary inundation of low-lying areas, especially streets, during exceptionally high tide events, such as at full and new moons.  The highest tides of the year may be known as the king tide, with the month varying by location.  In Florida, controversy was created when state-level government mandated that the term \"nuisance flooding\" and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott.  This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century.  The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than one meter (3.3 feet).  In the Miami area, where the vast majority of the land is below 10 ft , even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding.  The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about 4 ft MLLW, 3 ft above mean sea level, or about 2 ft NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW.  While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about 2 ft , with the greatest range being less than 2 m , the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation.  NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations.  During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times 1 ft or more over datum.\n\n9. The base level of a river or stream is the lowest point to which it can flow, often referred to as the 'mouth of the river'.  For large rivers, sea level is usually the base level, but a large river or lake is likewise the base level for tributary streams.  All rivers and streams erode toward sea level, which is also known as the \"ultimate base level.\"  A rather rare exception can be seen in the Jordan River, for which the base level is the Dead Sea, 417 m below modern sea level.  If a river is dammed, a new base level (the level of the reservoir) replaces the ultimate base level.  As a result, the stream\u2019s base level is raised.  Consequently, this reduces the stream\u2019s velocity, leads to deposition, and a reduction of the gradient upstream from the reservoir.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Middleton Island is a small, uninhabited island in the U.S. state of Alaska, located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 80 mi southwest of Cordova.  The island was briefly home to Middleton Island Air Force Station, an early warning radar station, from 1958 until the station's closure in 1963.  During the 1964 Alaska earthquake the island was raised an additional 12 ft above sea level.  The island now hosts the unattended Middleton Island Airport and a NEXRAD weather radar.\n\nThe 1964 Alaskan earthquake, also known as the Great Alaskan earthquake and Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 5:36 PM AST on Good Friday, March 27.

It was originally recorded by the space rock band Hawkwind, of whom the song's author, Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister, had been a member from 1971 to 1975.  It was the last song that he had written for them, but it had only been released as the B-side of the single \"Kings of Speed\", in March 1975.  In May of that year, Lemmy was fired from Hawkwind and formed a new band, naming it after the song.  It indicated the direction in which he planned to go: hard rock, not space rock.  Mot\u00f6rhead recorded two new versions of the song later that year, one as part of a demo session with producer Dave Edmunds and then another as part of the sessions for what was meant to have been Mot\u00f6rhead's debut album.  However, their record label, United Artists Records, decided to shelve the project and dropped the band without releasing any of the material.  Over a year later, the song was recorded yet again for Chiswick Records, during the session for their actual debut album and was released ahead of it, in June 1977, as their second 7\" single.\n\n1.

Samson and Delilah is a 1630 painting by Anthony van Dyck.  Like his 1620 version of the subject, it is in the style of his former master Peter Paul Rubens.  Unlike Rubens, however, van Dyck shows Delilah seemingly appalled at her own betrayal of Samson and regretting her act of treason, whereas Rubens showed him as a captive and her as an unscrupulous temptress.  Van Dyck's palette in the work also reveals the influence of Titian during van Dyck's stay in Italy.  It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\n\n1. Sir Anthony van Dyck (] , many variant spellings; 22 March 1599 \u2013 9 December 1641) was a Flemish Baroque artist who became the leading court painter in England, after enjoying great success in Italy and Flanders.  He is most famous for his portraits of Charles I of England and his family and court, painted with a relaxed elegance that was to be the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for the next 150 years.  He also painted biblical and mythological subjects, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in watercolour and etching.  The Van Dyke beard is named after him.\n\n2. Gonzales Coques (between 1614 and 1618 - 18 April 1684) was a Flemish painter of portraits and history paintings. Because of his artistic proximity to and emulation with Anthony van Dyck he received the nickname \"de kleine van Dyck\" (the little van Dyck).  Coques also worked as an art dealer.\n\n3.

Theodosius and Ambrose is a 1615/16 painting by Peter Paul Rubens, with assistance from his main pupil Anthony van Dyck.  It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

In the Rubens version, the architectural background is less defined, Theodosius is bearded and the spear and halberd in van Dyck's own version are omitted.\n\n5.

After Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, he was the leading Flemish Baroque painter of his day.  Unlike those contemporaries he never travelled abroad to study Italian painting, and his career is marked by an indifference to their intellectual and courtly aspirations.  In fact, except for a few short trips to locations in the Low Countries, he remained in Antwerp his entire life.  As well as being a successful painter, he was a prominent designer of tapestries.  Like Rubens, Jordaens painted altarpieces, mythological, and allegorical scenes, and after 1640\u2014the year Rubens died\u2014he was the most important painter in Antwerp for large-scale commissions and the status of his patrons increased in general.  However, he is best known today for his numerous large genre scenes based on proverbs in the manner of his contemporary Jan Brueghel the Elder, depicting \"The King Drinks\" and \"As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young\".  Jordaens' main artistic influences, besides Rubens and the Brueghel family, were northern Italian painters such as Jacopo Bassano, Paolo Veronese, and Caravaggio.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Charles I (19 November 1600 \u2013 30 January 1649 ) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.\n\nSir Anthony van Dyck (] , many variant spellings; 22 March 1599 \u2013 9 December 1641) was a Flemish Baroque artist who became the leading court painter in England, after enjoying great success in Italy and Flanders.

The Chicago, Indiana and Southern Railroad (reporting mark CI&S) is a defunct railroad which operated in the states of Illinois and Indiana during the early 20th century.  The CI&S formed in 1906 from the consolidation of the two other railroads: the Indiana, Illinois and Iowa Railroad and the Indiana Harbor Railroad.  The new railroad also owned the capital stock of the Danville and Indiana Harbor Railroad.  The stock of the new company itself was wholly owned by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Michigan Central Railroad, both of which were part of the New York Central system.  A 1907 report called the CI&S a \"tributary to the Lake Shore.\"  The railroad operated two lines: a north-south line between Indiana Harbor (East Chicago, Indiana) and Danville, Illinois, and a line from the Spring Valley coalfields at Seatonville, Illinois, to South Bend, Indiana.  Together the two lines controlled 301 mi of track.  In 1914 the CI&S was one of several railroads consolidated to form the modern New York Central Railroad.\n\n6. The Indiana Railroad (IR) was the last of the typical Midwestern United States interurban lines.  It was formed in 1930-31 by combining the operations of the five major interurban systems in central Indiana into one entity.  The predecessor companies came under the control of Midland Utilities, owned by Samuel Insull.  It was Insull's plan to transform the Indiana interurban network into a new Indiana Railroad by modernizing the profitable routes and abandoning the unprofitable ones.  With the onset of the Great Depression, the Insull empire collapsed and the Indiana Railroad was left with a decaying infrastructure and little hope for overcoming the growing competition of the automobile for passenger business and the truck for freight business.  The IR faced bankruptcy in 1933, and receiver Bowman Elder was designated to run the company.  Payments on bonded debt were suspended.  Elder was able to keep the system virtually intact for four years, and IR operated about 600 mi of interurban lines throughout Indiana during this period.  During the late 1930s, the routes were abandoned one by one until a 1941 wreck with fatalities south of Indianapolis put an abrupt end to the last operation of interurbans in Indiana.\n\n7. The Indiana and Ohio Railway (reporting mark IORY) is an American railroad that operates 570 mi of track in Ohio, southern Michigan, and parts of southeastern Indiana.  It is owned and operated by Genesee & Wyoming, who acquired the railroad in the 2012 purchase of RailAmerica.  The Indiana and Ohio Railroad (reporting mark INOH) (merged into the IORY in 1997) was formed in 1978 to operate a branch between Valley Junction, Ohio and Brookville, Indiana.  The IORY's original line, acquired in 1985, connected Mason and Monroe, Ohio.  The IORY set up a tourist operation known as the Indiana and Ohio Scenic Railway which operated over this line.  The tourist train still operates out of Lebanon, Ohio under the ownership of the Cincinnati Railway Company (CRC) under the name Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad.  Another line, acquired in 1986, runs from Norwood to Brecon, Ohio.  In 1991, the former DT&I between Washington Court House, Ohio and Springfield, Ohio came into the system via a designated operator agreement with the West Central Ohio Port Authority.  The system expanded north into Michigan in 1997 when it acquired the remainder of the former DT&I mainline between Diann, Michigan and Springfield, Ohio.  In 1994, it acquired two lines from Conrail in Springfield, Ohio: one between Springfield and Bellefontaine; and one between Springfield and Mechanicsburg.  The Indiana and Ohio Central Railroad (reporting mark IOCR) was the designated owner of these two lines until 2004.  One of the I&O's major events took place in 1996 when it was acquired by RailTex.

The Sudbury Dam Historic District is a historic district on the southeastern end of Sudbury Reservoir off MA 30 in Framingham and Southborough, Massachusetts.  The district encompasses the Sudbury Dam (also known as the Fayville Dam for the nearby neighborhood of Southborough), which impounds the reservoir, and an area encompassing several historic structures located below the dam.  The area includes water-supply-related structures from three phases of development of the Greater Boston water supply system.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\n\n1. The Goodnough Dike (actually a dam) is on the southeastern end of the Quabbin Reservoir, the largest water body in Massachusetts.  It impounds the waters of Beaver Brook and therefore closes that exit to the Chicopee River Watershed.  The Goodnough Dike is not as large as the Winsor Dam, but it is equally important as they both trap the waters of the Quabbin Reservoir.  This dam is part of the metropolitan Boston's water supply, maintained by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.\n\n2. X. Henry Goodnough, (1860\u20131935), engineer, was chairman of Boston's Metropolitan Water District in the 1920s and chief advocate for creation of the Quabbin Reservoir project.  Goodnough Dike was named for him. .\n\n3. Frank E. Winsor, civil engineer, was the chief engineer for the Boston Metropolitan District Water Supply Commission, now the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, from 1926 until his death in 1939 and was closely involved in the design and construction of Winsor Dam and Goodnough Dike which were built by the Commission to create the Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts.  Winsor Dam was named for him.\n\n4. The Winsor Dam and the Goodnough Dike impound the waters of the Swift River and the Ware River Diversion forming the Quabbin Reservoir, the largest water body in Massachusetts.  According to the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation the Winsor Dam is one of the largest dams in the Eastern U.S.  The Winsor Dam is part of the Chicopee River Watershed.  The Winsor Dam was named for Frank E. Winsor, its chief engineer.\n\n5. The Quabbin Reservoir is the largest inland body of water in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was built between 1930 and 1939.  Today along with the Wachusett Reservoir, it is the primary water supply for Boston, some 65 mi to the east, as well as 40 other communities in Greater Boston.  It also supplies water to three towns west of the reservoir and acts as backup supply for three others.  It has an aggregate capacity of 412 e9USgal and an area of 38.6 square miles (99.9 km\u00b2).\n\n6. Lake Steilacoom is a reservoir approximately 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) southwest of Tacoma in Pierce County, Washington, United States.  Its boundaries lie entirely within the city of Lakewood, Washington.  The reservoir covers approximately 306 acre , has a mean depth of 11 ft and a maximum depth of 20 ft .  Lake Steilacoom is a freshwater lake and drains into Puget Sound via Chambers Creek, which begins at its northern tip.  The lake is fed at its southeastern end by two creeks: Ponce de Leon Creek, which originates in springs below what is now Lakewood Towne Center, as well as Clover Creek which flows from its source near Frederickson to the lake.\n\n7. The Hillview Reservoir is a 90 acre storage reservoir in southeastern Yonkers, New York.  It was built within a six-year period from 1909\u20131915 by the New York City Board of Water Supply to receive water from the newly constructed Catskill Aqueduct, which drained water from the Ashokan Reservoir and sent it down into the Kensico Reservoir, where it would, in turn, be drained back into the Catskill Aqueduct, and sent into the Hillview Reservoir.  Frank E. Winsor was the engineer in charge of construction of both Hillview and Kensico as well as 32 mi of the Catskill Aqueduct.\n\n8.

The reservoir is the largest of the three Framingham reservoirs that were built at that time.  The dam's core is constructed of granite rubble laid in cement.  There is a granite-lined overfall area 100 ft long, which was originally topped by flashboards.  At the end of the overfall area nearest Route 9 stands the gatehouse, a granite structure with a rectangular main block and a smaller wing.  Both sections have a steeply pitched slate roof.  The door is in a round-arch recess, and the building is capped by a cupola.  It houses controls for two 4 ft mains connected to the Sudbury Aqueduct via the gatehouse at Reservoir No. 1.  The water is directed either directly beyond the dam into reservoir 1 or through the 4-foot mains to the Sudbury Aqueduct gatehouse.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Quabbin Reservoir is the largest inland body of water in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was built between 1930 and 1939.

The Army of Crime (French: L'Arm\u00e9e du crime ) is a 2009 French drama-war film directed by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian and based on a story by Serge Le P\u00e9ron, one of three credited for the screenplay.  It received a wide release in France on 16 September 2009 and opened in the United States in 2010.  The film deals with the events of the Affiche Rouge (\"red poster\") affair.  The title was taken from the caption on a propaganda poster, in which the Nazis sought to present prominent French Resistance fighters as foreign criminals; the caption read \"Liberators?  Liberation by the army of crime\".\n\n3.

It is also his second studio double album.\n\n6. The French Resistance (French: \"La R\u00e9sistance\" ) was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime during the Second World War.  R\u00e9sistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the Maquis in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines.  The men and women of the R\u00e9sistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society, including \u00e9migr\u00e9s; academics, students, aristocrats, conservative Roman Catholics (including priests) and also citizens from the ranks of liberals, anarchists and communists.\n\n7. Szlama Grzywacz (1909-1944) was one of the members of the French resistance executed at the fort of Mont Val\u00e9rien as a member of the Manouchian group, a volunteer of the French liberation army FTP-MOI.

Bernard Villemot (1911, Trouville-sur-Mer \u2013 1989) was a French graphic artist known primarily for his iconic advertising images for Orangina, Bally Shoe, Perrier, and Air France.  He was known for a sharp artistic vision that was influenced by photography, and for his ability to distill an advertising message to a memorable image with simple, elegant lines and bold colors.  From 1932\u20131934, he studied in Paris with artist Paul Colin, who was considered a master of Art Deco.  From 1945\u20131946, Villemot prepared posters for the Red Cross.  In the late 1940s, he also began a famous series of travel posters for Air France that would continue for decades.  In 1949, Villemot's works were exhibited with those of his contemporary poster artist Raymond Savignac at the Gallery of Beaux Arts in Paris.  In 1953, Villemot began designing logos and posters for the new soft drink Orangina, and over time these works would become some of his best known.  In 1963, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris held an exhibition of his works.  By the end of his life in 1989, he was known as one of the last great poster artists, and many collectors and critics consider him to be the \"painter-laureate of modern commercial art.\"  Since his death in 1989, his memorable images have been increasingly sought after by collectors.  At least three books have been published that survey his art: \"Les affiches de Villemot,\" by Jean-Francois Bazin (1985); \"Villemot: l\u2019affiche de A \u00e0 Z,\" by Guillaume Villemot (2005); and \"Embracing an icon: the posters of Bernard Villemot,\" by George H.

At 16 years of age, Pogodin started appearing on theater stage in small roles.  In 1922 he moved to Moscow, where he started working in small variety theaters performing funny songs.  In 1924 he was already appearing on the stage of the prestigious Hermitage Theater.  In 1938 Pogodin was invited to sing the lead role of Albert in an operetta titled \"Delicate Diplomacy\" (\"\u0422\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0438\u043f\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u044f\" by Johann Strauss) at the Moscow Theater of Miniatures; he performed at the theater in the 1938\u20131939 season.  Then he accidentally met theater director A. Arnold who invited him to sing the lead role in the operetta \"Chocolate Soldier\" (based on a work by Bernard Shaw, with music by the Pokrass brothers) that was set to open the 1939 summer season in the CDKA park.  The operetta, which played in the park for a month, featured many famous artists including the Alexander Tsfasman Jazz Orchestra, Maria Mironova, etc.  After that Tsfasman invited Pogodin to perform with his orchestra in the Khudozestvenny movie theater and on Saturdays and Sundays after midnight on the radio.  Pogodin also recorded a number of grammophone records.  And here composer and friend Konstantin Listov offered Pogodin to become the first artist to sing a new song he wrote.  The song, titled \"V Parke Chair\" (\"\u0412 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435 \u0427\u0430\u0438\u0440\"), instantly made \"widely known in narrow circles\" Pogodin a popular and trendy singer.  In December 1939, he decided to take part in the first All-Russian Variety Artists Contest and became a Laureat along with such singers as Klavdiya Shulzhenko, Keto Dzhaparidze, etc.  Since then he toured a lot and continued to sing on the radio.  His grammophone records were very popular.  Among his songs that were played everywhere were: \"V Parke Chair\", \"Vozvrata Net\" (\"\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\"), \"Ya Zhdu Pisma\" (\"\u042f \u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\"), \"Oglyanis\" (\"\u041e\u0433\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0441\u044c\").

Within the story, it is used by Maria to teach the notes of the major musical scale to the Von Trapp children who learn to sing for the first time, even though their father disallowed frivolity after their mother's death.  Each syllable of the musical solf\u00e8ge system appears in the song's lyrics, sung on the pitch it names.  Rodgers was helped in its creation by long-time arranger Trude Rittmann who devised the extended vocal sequence in the song.  According to assistant conductor Peter Howard, the heart of the number \u2013 in which Maria assigns a musical tone to each child, like so many Swiss bell ringers \u2013 was devised in rehearsal by Rittmann (who was credited for choral arrangements) and choreographer Joe Layton.  The fourteen note and tune lyric \u2013 'when you know the notes to sing...' \u2013 were provided by Rodgers and Hammerstein; the rest, apparently, came from Rittmann.  Howard: 'Rodgers allowed her to do whatever she liked.  When we started doing the staging of it, Joe took over.  He asked Trude for certain parts to be repeated, certain embellishments.'\n\n7. Jason Douglas Crabb (born March 3, 1977) is a Christian music singer and musician.  He has been the lead vocalist for the group The Crabb Family.\n\n8. A one-man band or one-woman band is a musician who plays a number of instruments simultaneously using their hands, feet, limbs, and various mechanical and/or electronic contraptions.  One person band musicians also often sing while they perform.  The simplest type of \"one-person band\" \u2014 a singer accompanying him/herself on acoustic guitar and playing a harmonica mounted in a metal \"harp rack\" below the mouth \u2014 is often used by buskers and folk music singer-guitarists.  More complicated setups may include wind instruments strapped around the neck, a large bass drum mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, cymbals strapped between the knees or triggered by a pedal mechanism, tambourines and maracas tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a banjo, ukulele or guitar).  Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers, and electronic pedal keyboards into their set-ups.  In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals enables singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo and/or sing over it.\n\n9.

However, the 1925 Bears were the most notable team in the young NFL's history to that point\u2014all because of the addition of college star Red Grange.

Grange was under contract but did not play on November 22 as the Bears defeated the Packers in a rematch.  When Grange did suit up for his first game on Thanksgiving Day against the Cardinals, an estimated 39,000 showed up to see a 0\u20130 tie.

In the sport of baseball, small ball is an informal term for an offensive strategy in which the batting team emphasizes placing runners on base and then advancing them into scoring position for a run in a deliberate, methodical way.  This strategy places a high value on individual runs and attempts to score them without requiring extra base hits, or sometimes without base hits at all, instead using bases on balls, stolen bases, sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly balls, the hit-and-run play, and aggressive baserunning with such plays as the contact play.  A commonly used term for a run produced playing small ball is a \"manufactured run\".  This style of play is more often found in National League game situations than in the American League due in large part to the absence of the designated hitter in the National League.\n\n1.

One of the top football leagues in the country, it currently shares the top spot in the Indian football league system with the I-League.  The league comprises 10 teams and will run for five months from November to March starting with the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n2. Jeared Wells \"Bill\" Pounds (March 11, 1878 \u2013 July 7, 1936) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.  He appeared in just two major league games, one each for Cleveland and Brooklyn in 1903, but the only surviving images of him in a major league uniform show him with the New York Highlanders.  Bill Pounds was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a long career as a minor league pitcher.  His professional career began in 1899 when he pitched for both Binghamton and Paterson.  After a year out of organized baseball, he played in 1901 and 1902 for two Ilion and Utica in the New York State League.  After reportedly signing a contract to return to Utica for 1903, he was signed by Cleveland in the American League and was on their Opening Day roster.  Pounds was brought in to pitch on May 2 in the fourth inning in Chicago when the White Stockings had opened up a big lead; he gave up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in the 16-6 loss.  On May 18 he was released by Cleveland and was signed shortly thereafter by the New York Highlanders.  Pounds was in uniform with the team when the Highlanders visited Chicago for a series May 20\u201322.  A photographer from the Chicago Daily News was taking pictures of the players on the teams visiting both the American League and National League ballparks, and during this visit Pounds had his image preserved for posterity.  Before the end of the month, without having appeared in a game for New York, Pounds was sent back to Cleveland, apparently because he could not come to terms on a contract.  On June 4 he was signed by Brooklyn of the National League, but he did not appear in a game until June 30.  With Pittsburg ahead 12-0 after three innings, Pounds was sent in to pitch.  He allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings on eight hits and two walks in the 17-8 loss, and gave up a long home run to Honus Wagner.  On July 3, his contract was transferred to Baltimore of the Eastern League, along with that of Hughie Jennings and three other Dodgers.  Pounds would never appear in another major league game; though his pitching record was unimpressive, he finished with a lifetime batting record of three hits in five at-bats.  Late in the 1903 season, his contract was purchased by Denver, but it is unclear whether he actually played in Colorado.  For the remainder of his minor-league career, from 1904 through 1911, he pitched for teams within a couple of hundred miles of his birth\u2014four teams in the New York State League and two in the Tri-State League.  In the off-seasons he would sometimes pitch for the Paterson Elks team, and he continued to pitch for them after his minor-league career had ended.  According to The Sporting Life, \u201cPounds has speed and a rather good assortment of curves.  He has not the best control in the world.\u201d  A few years after his career had ended, the Utica Observer described him in this way: \u201cBill Pounds was the champion sweater of the league.  He perspired so much that\u2026a miniature lake (formed) around the slab.\u201d  He died in 1936 in the city of his birth, aged 58.  Early in the 21st century, the photographic archives of the Chicago Daily News were posted online.  Although his teammates\u2019 photographs were easily identified, the image of Pounds remained unidentified, or occasionally misidentified as Doc Adkins, for at least a decade.\n\n3. Treadway Racing is a former auto racing team that competed in the early seasons of the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series.  The team was owned by Indianapolis business man Fred Treadway.  Prior to the IRL's inaugural season in 1996, Treadway was able to sign former Indianapolis 500 Champion Arie Luyendyk to drive for his freshman team.  Additionally, two long time backers of IndyCar teams, Bryant Heating & Cooling Systems and Jonathan Byrd's Cafeteria, were secured as sponsors.  Luyendyk brought home the team's first win in their second race together, winning the Dura-Lube 200 at Phoenix International Raceway.  Later that season Luyendyk would set two qualifying records at the Indianapolis 500.  Luyendyk would run 236.986 mi/h over the four lap run, during this run he also set the one-lap record of 237.498-mph.  This run would not put Luyendyk on the pole position however, as the run was on the second day of time trials.  Luyendyk's attempt on the first day of qualifications was disallowed when he failed technical inspection although it was good enough for the pole.  His day two attempt was faster than his day one attempt.  Ultimately Luyendyk was knocked out of the race in an accident.\n\n4. Season 2001\u201302 was a turbulent one for Hibernian, as the team had three different permanent managers during the season.  Alex McLeish left the club in December to manage Rangers; Hibs surprisingly replaced him with star player Franck Sauz\u00e9e, who retired as a player when he was appointed manager.  Sauzee's brief tenure saw a long winless run in the SPL and domestic cup defeats by Rangers and Ayr United.  The winless run in the league dragged Hibs into the fringes of a relegation battle, and Sauzee was sacked after just 69 days in charge.  Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson was hired as Sauzee's replacement, and a brief winning run averted any danger of relegation.  Earlier in the season, Hibs had been knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the first round by AEK Athens, but only after a dramatic second leg at Easter Road that went to extra time.\n\n5.

United States Senator Henry Cabot Lodge from Massachusetts was the Republican Majority Leader and Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations.  In response to the Treaty of Versailles, Senator Lodge penned twelve reservations to the proposed post-war agreements.  The Treaty called for the creation of a League of Nations in which the promise of mutual security would hopefully prevent another major world war.  The League charter which Wilson primarily wrote let the League set the terms for war and peace.  If the League called for military action all members would have to join in.  Lodge wanted to join the League of Nations with reservations.  The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with his reservations.  Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations which meant the League could force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress.  In the end the Senate voted down the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and never joined the new League of Nations.  Lodge won in the long run\u2014his reservations were incorporated into the United Nations in 1945, where the U.S. had a veto.\n\n8. Evan Michael Longoria (born October 7, 1985), nicknamed Longo, is an American professional baseball player.  He played for the Long Beach State University baseball team, where he was the 2005 Cape Cod League MVP, and the 2006 Big West Co-Player of the Year.  He was drafted by the Rays in the first round as the third pick overall in the 2006 MLB draft.  After two full seasons in the minors, he made his major league debut for the Rays in , and was named to the American League team for the 2008 MLB All Star Game.  Longoria was also named the 2008 American League Rookie of the Year on November 10.  Longoria has also made the All-Star team three times, being selected from 2008 to 2010.  Longoria had one of the biggest hits in Rays history when he hit a walk off home run in extra innings of the last game of the 2011 season, snapping a tie with the Red Sox in the race for the American League wildcard spot and sending his team into the postseason.\n\n9. Cyberball (\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb , Saib\u0101b\u014dru ) is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets set in the year 2022.  The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used.  Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble.  A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball.  The robots also possess finite durability.  As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits.  A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball.  Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play.  Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose.  On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Souvik Chakrabarti (born 12 July 1991 in Kolkata, West Bengal) is an Indian footballer who plays as a central midfielder for club Jamshedpur FC in the Indian Super League.\n\nThe Indian Super League (ISL) is a men's professional football league in India.

Kennedy.  She married Oswald during his temporary defection to the Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States with him.  She was not implicated in the assassination and remarried two years following Oswald's murder.\n\n1. The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald is a 1964 American film from Larry Buchanan.  It is the first speculative trial drama to be produced about Lee Harvey Oswald only a few months after the assassination of John F. Kennedy along with the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald himself.  The film was made in Dallas, and served as an idea of what the trial would have been like had it occurred, if Oswald hadn't been killed by Jack Ruby.  In the film, the prosecution asserts Oswald committed the crime for political reasons due to his Marxist beliefs, while Oswald's attorney presents an insanity defense, claiming he suffered from untreated paranoid schizophrenia since adolescence.  Since the viewer acts as a juror, no verdict is given.\n\n2. Michael Ralph Paine (born June 25, 1928) is a retired engineer.  He became notable after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, because he was an acquaintance of the President's purported assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.  His wife, Ruth Hyde Paine, housed Lee's estranged wife, Marina Oswald, in her home for several months before the assassination until the day after it.\n\n3. In March 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald, using the alias \"A. Hidell,\" purchased by mail order a 6.5\u00d752mm Carcano Model 91/38 infantry rifle (described by the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy as a \"Mannlicher\u2013Carcano\" ) rifle with a telescopic sight.  He also purchased a revolver from a different company, by the same method.  The Hidell alias was determined from multiple sources to be Oswald.  It is officially accepted that the rifle was fired by Oswald from the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, Texas, to assassinate United States President John F. Kennedy as his motorcade drove by on November 22, 1963.  Photographs of Oswald holding the rifle, a palmprint found upon examination of the rifle, and detective work tracing its sale, all eventually led to Oswald.  Marina Oswald later testified she was told by Lee that the rifle was also used before in an attempt to assassinate retired U.S. Army General Edwin Walker in Dallas.\n\n4. Gerald Leo Posner (born May 20, 1954) is an American investigative journalist and author of twelve books, including \"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK\" (1993), which explores the John F. Kennedy assassination, and \"Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.\" (1998), about the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. A plagiarism scandal involving his articles and books arose in 2010.  In 2015, the \"Chicago Tribune\" called Posner \"a merciless pitbull of an investigator.\"\n\n5. James Patrick Hosty Jr. (August 28, 1924 \u2013 June 10, 2011) was an American FBI agent assigned to investigate Lee Harvey Oswald upon Oswald's June 1962 return to the United States after his defection to the Soviet Union.  After Hosty made contact with Marina Oswald (a Soviet citizen) in order to interview her about her recent entry into the United States, Oswald wrote him a letter to protest the \"harassment\" of his wife Marina, and had Hosty's name and phone number in his address book.  After the Kennedy assassination, Hosty did not disclose Oswald's letter about Marina to the Warren Commission and destroyed it on his superior's order.  Because of this, Hosty attracted speculation as a possible conspirator in several conspiracy theories.  Hosty was transferred to the FBI's Kansas City office until his mandatory retirement in 1979.  Hosty later wrote a memoir about the Kennedy assassination, titled \"Assignment: Oswald\".\n\n6. Ruth Hyde Paine (born September 3, 1932) was a friend of Marina Oswald, who was living with her at the time of the JFK assassination.  According to five government investigations, Lee Harvey Oswald stored the 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle that he used to assassinate U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Ruth Paine's garage, unbeknownst to her and her husband, Michael Paine.\n\n7. Hugh Grant Aynesworth (born August 2, 1931) is an American journalist, investigative reporter, author, and teacher.  Aynesworth has been reported to have witnessed the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza, the capture and arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas Theater, and the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas Police Headquarters.  In a 1976 \"Texas Monthly\" article, William Broyles, Jr. described Aynesworth as \"one of the most respected authorities on the assassination of John F. Kennedy\".\n\n8. The Ruth Paine Home at 2515 W. 5th Street in Irving, Texas, United States, is the location where Lee Harvey Oswald spent the night before assassinating President John F.

Robert Sarazin Blake, now more commonly known by his middle name and surname, Sarazin Blake, is an American singer-songwriter hailing from Bellingham, WA.  Blake is generally considered a folk musician, though his music incorporates elements of traditional Celtic songwriters, modern punk rock, country, and blues all blended together with a heavy dose of improvisation.  This melding of varying genres produces a \"speed strumming style\" that functions as a backdrop to Blake's narrative style of songwriting.  Although Blake also writes songs centered on love and his personal life, his leftist-anarchist politics feature prominently in many of his works.  Examples of this can be found in songs such as \"Didn't We,\" \"Culture of Resistance,\" and \"Philadelphia;\" all of which promote the values of an anti-consumerist and independent spirit.  He is known for his extensive touring; often traversing the entire United States and Ireland for much of the year.  Although such an exhaustive touring schedule occupies a lot of Blake's time, he also makes sure to spend a good part of his time in and around his hometown of Bellingham, WA, where he organizes and performs in the Subdued String Band Jamboree each year in addition to playing and recording at many of the local bars and clubs.

Asphodelus macrocarpus is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the genus \"Asphodelus\" of the Asphodelaceae family.  The Latin name \"macrocarpus\" of this species derives from the Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (meaning \"large\") and \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (meaning \"fruit\"), referred to the size of the fruits.\n\n1. Ceratonia is small genus of flowering trees in the pea family, Fabaceae, endemic to the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.  Its best known member, the carob tree, is cultivated for its pods and has been widely introduced to regions with similar climates.  The genus was long considered monotypic, but a second species, \"Ceratonia oreothauma\", was identified in 1979 from Oman and Somalia.  It belongs to the subfamily Caesalpinioideae, tribe Caesalpinieae.\n\n2. \u00c7iri\u015f is a village in Erdemli district of Mersin Province, Turkey.  It is situated to the south of dense forestry of the Taurus Mountains.  Distance to Erdemli is 12 km and to Mersin is 48 km .  The population of \u00c7iri\u015f was 910 as of 2012.  The village was founded in a place full of ancient ruins.  It was named after the Turkish name of the plant Asphodelus.  The main econo\u0131mic activity of the village is farming.  Various vegetables and fruits (including greenhouse crops) are produced.  Tropical fruits like avocado and kiwifruit are also produced.\n\n3. Plant functional types (PFTs) is a system used by climatologists to classify plants according to their physical, phylogenetic and phenological characteristics as part of an overall effort to develop a vegetation model for use in land use studies and climate models. PFTs provide a finer level of modeling than biomes, which represent gross areas such as desert, savannah, deciduous forest.  In creating a PFT model, areas as small as 1\u00a0km are modeled by defining the predominant plant type for that area, interpreted from satellite data or other means.  For each plant functional type, a number of key parameters are defined, such as fecundity, competitiveness, resorption (rate at which plant decays and returns nutrients to the soil after death), etc.; the value of each parameter is determined or inferred from observable characteristics such as plant height, leaf area, etc.\n\n4. Somatic embryogenesis is an artificial process in which a plant or embryo is derived from a single somatic cell or group of somatic cells.  Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue.  No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo.  Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology.  Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus.  Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form from the callus.  The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant.  Somatic embryos are mainly produced \"in vitro\" and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR\u2019s).  The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount.  Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types.  Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement.  The first documentation of somatic embryogenesis was by Steward et al. in 1958 and Reinert in 1959 with carrot cell suspension cultures.\n\n5. The William H. Zimmer Power Station, located near Moscow, Ohio, is a coal-fired power plant owned by Dynegy, Inc. It was originally intended to be a boiling water reactor type of nuclear power plant.  Although once estimated to be 97% complete, poor construction and quality assurance (QA) led to the plant being converted to coal-fired generation.  As of 2012, the plant generates 1460 gross MWe and 1300 net MWe.  Zimmer Power Station is the largest single-unit power facility in the United States.  During the construction of the plant, the Little Indian Creek was routed through the plant to protect fish populations.  The plant now has several unique environmental protection features to keep the creek at its natural state.\n\n6. The abundances of plant species are often measured by plant cover, i.e. the relative area covered by different plant species in a small plot.  Plant cover is not biased by the size and distributions of individuals, and is an important and often measured characteristic of the composition of plant communities.  Plant cover data may be used to classify the studied plant community into a vegetation type, to test different ecological hypothesis on plant abundance, and in gradient studies, where the effects of different environmental gradients on the abundance of specific plant species are investigated.\n\n7. Asphodelus fistulosus is a species of plant known as hollow-stemmed asphodel, onionweed, onion-leafed asphodel, and pink asphodel.  It is native to the Mediterranean region.  It is an invasive exotic weed in the United States, with significant infestations in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  It is listed as a Federal Noxious Weed by the United States Department of Agriculture.  It is also a common weed in parts of Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico, and it thrives in any area with a Mediterranean climate.\n\n8.

Media Richness Theory, sometimes referred to as information richness theory or MRT, is a framework used to describe a communication medium's ability to reproduce the information sent over it.  It was introduced by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory.  MRT is used to rank and evaluate the richness of certain communication media, such as phone calls, video conferencing, and email.  For example, a phone call cannot reproduce visual social cues such as gestures which makes it a less rich communication media than video conferencing, which affords the transmission of gestures and body language.  Based on contingency theory and information processing theory, MRT explains that richer, personal communication mediums are generally more effective for communicating of equivocal issues than leaner, less rich media.\n\n4.

Vegetation consists of sagebrush, bitterbrush, and bunch grass.  Vagabond Army Airfield and Selah Airstrip are located on the Yakima Training Center.  The training center is also used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force for exercises.\n\n6. The Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing or LC4MP is an explanatory theory that assumes humans have a limited capacity for cognitive processing of information, as it associates with mediated message variables; moreover, they (viewers) are actively engaged in processing mediated information Like many mass communication theories, LC4MP is an amalgam that finds its origins in psychology.  Specifically, this theory has its origins in the Limited Capacity Model for understanding cognitive information processing.  The most fundamental assumptions of information processing are the three dimensions of cognitive processing.  The three dimensions: 1) encoding, 2) storage, and 3) retrieval.  This is how viewers get presented information into their heads.  Messages can be processed under controlled conditions or they can be automatically elicited.\n\n7.

Financial infidelity is the secretive act of spending money, possessing credit and credit cards, holding secret accounts or stashes of money, borrowing money, or otherwise incurring debt unknown or unwilling to one's spouse, partner, or significant other.  Financial infidelity in a relationship may also include any financial decision(s) made by a partner that may effect, burden, strain or set back the financial planning of the relationship.  Adding to the monetary strain commonly associated with financial infidelity in a relationship is a subsequent loss of intimacy and trust in the relationship.  Financial infidelity appears to be on the rise, with a 2005 study showing that 30% of respondents had lied about financial information and 25% had withheld information, whereas a 2008 study showed that half the respondents had committed some form of financial infidelity.\n\n9.

The band is notably remembered for their hit songs \"High\" and \"Life's A Joke\".  The song \"High\" was ranked in the Top 40 in the Philippines (it was the no. 1 single for seven weeks), while \"Life's A Joke\" stayed on the Top 30 for almost 6 months in the Philippines in 2005.  Their album, according to the \"Manila Bulletin\", debuted and remained as number one on the Filetopia online radio station in the United Kingdom.  The album, entitled \"This is the Time\" was a hit in Asia radio charts (including Magic 89.9's Final Countdown, and in the Top 20 of 97.1 WLS-FM), and the album's title track reached the Top 15 in the United States.  Their music videos have been featured on MTV Asia and MYX.

Lincolnshire Posy is a piece by Percy Grainger for concert band composed in 1937 for the American Bandmasters Association.  Considered Grainger's masterpiece, the 16-minute-long work is composed of six movements, each adapted from folk songs that Grainger had collected on a 1905\u20131906 trip to Lincolnshire, England.  The work debuted with three of the movements on March 7, 1937 by the Milwaukee Symphonic Band, a group composed of members from several bands including the Blatz Brewery and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer factory worker bands in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n4. \"Guitar Hero 5\" is the fifth main title in the \"Guitar Hero\" series of rhythm games, released worldwide in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3 and Wii consoles.  In the game, players use special instrument controllers to simulate the playing of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals for rock and other songs.  Players are awarded points by performing specific actions on the controllers to match notes that scroll on screen that correspond with the appropriate instrument.  Successfully hitting notes increases the player's scoring and performance meter, while missing too many notes will lower the performance meter and may cause the song to end prematurely.  Songs can be played either by oneself, competitively with other players in several game modes, or cooperative with up to three other players in their own virtual band.  Although traditionally a four-player band can have one player on each instrument, \"Guitar Hero 5\" allows any four-player combination of these instruments to be used, such as a band composed of four drummers.  \"Guitar Hero 5\" is considered by its developers to be an expansion of the series into more \"social play\", featuring modes such as Party Play, which allows players to drop in and out and change difficulty in the middle of a song without worrying about failing or losing points.\n\n5. The Moody Blues are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1964.  They first came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music, but their second album, \"Days of Future Passed\", which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music and established them as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock.  It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\".  They became known internationally with singles including \"Go Now\", \"Nights in White Satin\", \"Tuesday Afternoon\" and \"Question\".  They have been awarded 18 platinum and gold discs.  The Moody Blues have sold 70 million records worldwide.\n\n6. \"Steppin' in a Slide Zone\" is a 1978 single by the English progressive rock band The Moody Blues.  It was the first single The Moody Blues had released in five years, after the band's temporary hiatus.  It was written by bassist John Lodge, and was released a month later on the album \"Octave\".  The song peaked at number 39 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 41 in Canada.\n\n7. \"'Bad Motor Scooter\" was the second track from the album \"Montrose\" by the band of the same name.  It, along with \"Rock Candy\", was arguably the best known song by the band, Montrose.  The song was penned by frontman Sammy Hagar.  Its intro, a distorted electric slide guitar sound which closely emulates that of a revving motorcycle, became the defining component of the song.  When the song was conceived before this guitar sound, the band and Ted Templeman were not impressed because they thought it was missing a \"hook\", to make it stand out.  Ronnie Montrose stumbled upon it while messing with a slide and fuzz box one day in the studio.  Playing his guitar in Open D tuning, Montrose improvised what became the motorcycle sound \u2014 although Templeman and engineer Donn Landee kept him going when they failed to get the tape rolling.  []\n\n8. \"M\u0101ya Love\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1974 album \"Dark Horse\".  The song originated as a slide guitar tune, to which Harrison later added lyrics relating to the illusory nature of love \u2013 \"maya\" being a Sanskrit term for \"illusion\", or \"that which is not\".  Harrison's biographers consider the lyrical theme to be reflective of his failed marriage to Pattie Boyd, who left him for his friend Eric Clapton shortly before the words were written.  Harrison recorded the song at his home, Friar Park, on the eve of his North American tour with Ravi Shankar, which took place in November and December 1974.  The recording features Harrison's slide guitar extensively and contributions from four musicians who formed the nucleus of his tour band: Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark.  Reviewers note the track as an example of its parent album's more diverse musical genres, namely funk and rhythm and blues, compared with the more traditional rock orientation of Harrison's earlier solo work.\n\n9. \"Zenzenzense\" (Japanese: \u524d\u524d\u524d\u4e16 , \"Past Past Past Life\") is a song by Japanese rock band Radwimps.  It was used as one of the four theme songs to the animated film \"Your Name\", and was one of 26 songs the band composed for the film's soundtrack.  It reached number-one on the \"Billboard\" Japan Hot 100.  It also received a digital download song certification of Triple Platinum from the Recording Industry Association of Japan for sales of 750,000.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Moody Blues are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1964.

The stop-question-and-frisk program, or stop-and-frisk, in New York City, is a New York City Police Department practice of temporarily detaining, questioning, and at times searching civilians on the street for weapons and other contraband.  This is what is known in other places in the United States as the \"Terry\" stop.  The rules for stop, question, and frisk are found in the state's criminal procedure law section 140.50, and are based on the decision of the US Supreme Court in the case of \"Terry v. Ohio\".\n\n1. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) was a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that unlike in the election of the United States Senate, in the election of \"any\" chamber of a state legislature the electoral districts must be roughly equal in population (thus negating the traditional function of a State Senate, which was to allow rural counties to counter balance large towns and cities).  The case was brought on behalf of voters in Alabama by M.O. Sims, a taxpayer in Birmingham, Alabama, but affected both northern and southern states that had similarly failed to reapportion their legislatures in keeping with changes in state population after its application in five companion cases in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.\n\n2. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during police investigations did not violate the Fourth Amendment \"if\" the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement.  Under the rubric of \"Terry v. Ohio\", 392 U.S. 1 (1968) , the minimal intrusion on a suspect's privacy, and the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to quickly dispel suspicion that an individual is engaged in criminal activity, justified requiring a suspect to disclose his or her name.\n\n3. George Reynolds (January 1, 1842 \u2013 August 9, 1909) was a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a longtime secretary to the First Presidency of the LDS Church, and a party to the 1878 United States Supreme Court case \"Reynolds v. United States\", the first freedom of religion case to issue from that court.\n\n4. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto.)  145 (1878), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that held that religious duty was not a defense to a criminal indictment.  \"Reynolds\" was the first Supreme Court opinion to address the Impartial Jury and the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment.\n\n5. Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court that extended \"Terry v. Ohio\", 392 U.S. 1 (1968) to allow searches of car compartments during a stop with \"reasonable suspicion\".  The case also clarified and narrowed the extent of adequate and independent state ground, allowing U.S. Supreme Court review of state supreme court decisions unless they explicitly appealed to state laws.\n\n6. During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases.  In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice.  Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v.

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is not violated when a police officer stops a suspect on the street and frisks him or her without probable cause to arrest, if the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime and has a reasonable belief that the person \"may be armed and presently dangerous.\"\n\n8. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990) , is a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First Amendment allows states to outlaw the mere possession, as distinct from the distribution, of child pornography.  In so doing, the Court extended the holding of \"New York v. Ferber\", 458 U.S. 747 (1982) , which had upheld laws banning the distribution of child pornography against a similar First Amendment challenge, and distinguished \"Stanley v. Georgia\", 394 U.S. 557 (1969) , which had struck down a Georgia law forbidding the possession of pornography by adults in their own homes.  The Court also determined that the Ohio law at issue was not overbroad, relying on a narrowing interpretation of the law the Ohio Supreme Court had adopted in prior proceedings in the case.  However, because it was unclear whether the State had proved all the elements of the crime, the Court ordered a new trial.\n\n9. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\"  Specifically, it struck down Ohio's criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence.  In the process, \"Whitney v. California\" (1927) was explicitly overruled, and doubt was cast on \"Schenck v. United States\" (1919), \"Abrams v. United States\" (1919), \"Gitlow v.

By the time of the recordings, Scott-Heron had published a volume of poetry and his first novel, \"The Vulture\".  Well received by music critics who found Scott-Heron's material imaginative, \"Small Talk at 125th and Lenox\" has been described as \"a volcanic upheaval of intellectualism and social critique\" by Allmusic editor John Bush.\n\n6. Hollywood on Television was a five-and-a-half-hour, six-day-a-week live television talk show starring newcomer Betty White and radio disc jockey Al Jarvis that ran from 1949 to 1953.  When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned.  White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result.  After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches.  Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step.  Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches.  Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes.  Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".\n\n7. At Your Request was an Australian television daytime series which aired from 1958 to 1959.  The series aired on Tuesdays at 2:30PM on Melbourne station HSV-7, and was hosted by baritone Charles Skase, who was also known as a radio personality.  Information on this series is scarce.  The series presented requested songs, but it is not clear how these songs were presented (such as whether it was a disc jockey series like \"TV Disc Jockey\", a lip-sync series like \"Hit Parade\", or a live music series like \"Sweet and Low\").  The archival status of the series is also not known, although being a daytime series aired in a single city means it is unlikely (though not impossible) that kinescope recordings exist of it.\n\n8.

Western Air Command was the part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's Home War Establishment responsible for air operations on the Pacific coast of Canada during the Second World War.  When Canada declared war against Germany in September 1939 the command consisted of only five squadrons.  Four of them equipped with obsolete aircraft including a bomber squadron with aircraft from the Great War and there were no fighter aircraft at all for its only fighter squadron (113 Fighter Squadron was thus disbanded).  With the Japanese threat after Pearl Harbor it grew rapidly and played a critical role in fighter and anti-submarine operations in Canadian and American waters during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.  It was there that Squadron Leader K.A. Boomer of No. 111 Squadron shot down a Rufe fighter, the RCAF's only kill in the Pacific Theatre.  On 7 July 1942 a Bristol Bolingbroke pressed home an attack on the Japanese Submarine Ro 32 the pilot F/Sgt.  P.M.G. Thomas of No. 115 Squadron RCAF then led American Destroyers to sink the damaged submarine.  By January 1943 Western Air Command had expanded to include many bomber, fighter and operational units under its control.

These were the 163 Army Cooperation Squadron in March flying Bristol Bolingbrokes and Hawker Hurricanes, in May the 160 Bomber-Reconnaissance Squadron was added flying Cansos from Sea Island BC (before moving to Yarmouth NS in July) and the 166 Communication Squadron formed in September flying various types.  In addition to the new squadrons, new aircraft types came on line replacing the command's remaining Supermarine Stranraers and Blackburn Sharks with Canso's and the Bolingbrokes and Beauforts with the Lockheed Ventura.

With the end of the war in Europe these aircraft were joined by a number of Victory Aircraft Lancaster X bombers which were to be used to train the British Commonwealth's Very Long Range Bomber Tiger Force that would soon be sent to bomb the Japanese mainland from Okinawa.  With the unconditional surrender of Japan the RCAF's Tiger Force bomber squadrons were disbanded before they flew overseas and the total draw down of the Western Air Command was suddenly undertaken.

The North American Arctic comprises the northern portions of Alaska (USA), Northern Canada and Greenland.  Major bodies of water include the Arctic Ocean, Hudson Bay, the Gulf of Alaska and North Atlantic Ocean.  The western limit is the Seward Peninsula and the Bering Strait.  The southern limit is the Arctic Circle latitude of 66\u00b0 33\u2019N, which is the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night.\n\n1. The Northumbrian language or Northumbria English is an English language or dialect of English (\"\"Northumbrian Language\"\" may only refer to the broadly spoken Northumbrian whereas Northumbrian English may just refer to the Standard English as spoken in Northumbria and featuring various Northumbrian words and forms), and a variant of Northern English with the Geordie dialect being one of the subsets of Northumbrian the others being Northern (north of the River Coquet), Western (from Allendale through Hexham up to Kielder), Southern or Pitmatic (the mining towns such as Ashington and much of Durham) Mackem (Wearside), Smoggie (Teesside) and possibly also Tyke (Yorkshire).  It is spoken mainly if not exclusively in the modern day counties of Northumberland and Durham.  Whilst all sharing similarities to the more famous Geordie dialect and most of the time not distinguishable by non-native speakers, there are a few differences between said dialects not only between them and Geordie but also each other.\n\n2. It was thought that Ahirani or Khandeshi dialect is spoken in Old Khandesh district.  Now old Khandesh District of Maharashtra is divided in several districts.  Those are Jalgaon district, Dhulia District, Nandurbar district, Part of Nasik District and part of Aurangabad District.  Ahiras spoke Ahirani dialect.  Ahir Wani means dialect of Ahiras.  Wani means dialect.  It is known as Ahirani as it was spoken by Ahiras.  Same dialect in this region is known as Khandeshi dialect.  Because it is dialect of old Khandesh district.  Khandeshi is regional name and Ahirani is social name for same dialect.  Ahirani was spoken within the basin of Satpura Range and Sanhyadri Range.  High picks of Satpuda, of Sanhyadri range (Chandwad and Ajanta) did not allowed to spread this dialect out of this closed area of Khandesh District.  But similar dialect having similar social rituals, similar lexicography, phonology and syntax newly foundout by Dr. Ramesh Suryawanshi in Melghat area of Amaravati district.  Near about fifty villages where Gawali people reside speak Gawali dialect.  This dialect was not included in Griererson's Survey of India or Dr. Ganesh Devi's recent Bhasha Surveykshan.  Gavali dialect and Ahirani dialect are same and one.  Ahiras of Khandesh as well as Gawali of Melghat claim as they belong to God Shri Krishna's family.  Both having back history of having relation with Ashirgad Fort, and Goddess Asha Devi.  Both are cowherds indulged in business of milk and cattle.  Gawali's of Malghat are not literate and reside in forest.  Ahiras reside in towns and villages which are connected to metrocities with roads and railways.  Ahiras left most of their past rituals and traditions.  Ahiras of Khandesh nowadays are known by their business where as Gawalis are milkmen and cowherds. Most of their surnames are different.  Gavali's of Melghat give milk and milk products free of cost to villagers with rotation as per their Surnames.  It is considered that Gawali famili of Shaniware Surname should distribute milk and milk products free of cost on Saturday.  ( Shaniwar is word for Saturday )Gavali reside in Paratwada, Chandur, Melghat, Amarwati, Yeotmal Chimur tehsils of Vidarbhs Region.  A legend discloses history of Gawali's migration to Melghat area.  Lord Krishna went to Kaundanyapur with these Gawalis along with their several cattle.  As lord Krishna returned with his beloved Rukmani from Kaundannyapur.  Some Gawalis with their cattle decided to reside therein Melghat area as it was rich grassy land, good for their cattle.  This legendary story discloses the fact that Ahiras of Khandesh and Gawalis of Melghat both are of same race.  So their dialect is same and one.  This face is just disclosed by Dr. Ramesh suryawanshi in his article published in Critical Enquiry Vol.VI Issue IV.  Oct.- Dec. 2014 by Institute of Knowledge Engineering.\n\n3. The English language in Northern England has been shaped by the region's history of settlement and migration, and today encompasses a group of related dialects known as Northern England English (or, simply, Northern English in the United Kingdom).  Historically, the strongest influence on the varieties of the English language spoken in Northern England was the Northumbrian dialect of Old English, but contact with Old Norse during the Viking Age and with Irish English following the Great Famine have produced new and distinctive styles of speech.  Some \"Northern\" traits can be found further south than others: only the northernmost accents of Northumberland and Tyneside retain the pre-Great Vowel Shift pronunciation of words such as \"town\" ( , \"\"toon\"\"), but all northern accents lack the \u2013 split, and this trait extends a significant distance into the Midlands.\n\n4. Wedderburn is a community in Central Otago, New Zealand.  It is located 15 kilometres northwest of Ranfurly, and was at one time close to the centre of a thriving gold and coal mining area.  The name of Wedderburn was given to the area by John Turnbull Thomson, and is one of the names in his infamous \"Thomson's Barnyard\", wedder being Northumbrian dialect form of the word , meaning a castrated sheep.\n\n5. The Kingdom of Northumbria ( ; Old English: \"Nor\u00fehymbra r\u012bce\" , \"kingdom of the Northumbrians\") was a medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now northern England and south-east Scotland, which subsequently became an earldom in a unified English kingdom.  The name reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the Humber estuary.\n\n6. The Gali\u010dnik dialect (Macedonian: \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442 , \"Gali\u010dki dijalekt\") or Mala Reka dialect (Macedonian: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442 , \"Malorekanski dijalekt\") is a member of the subgroup of western and north western dialects of the western group of dialects of the Macedonian language.  The dialect is spoken on small territory on the mountain Bistra in western part of the Republic of Macedonia.  The name of the dialect is derived by the biggest village in that area- Gali\u010dnik.  Also the dialect is spoken in many other small villages including the village Gari.  The Gali\u010dnik dialect is closely related with the Reka dialect which is spoken north-western of Gali\u010dnik dialect.  This dialect is well known in Republic of Macedonia because of the archaic words that this dialect has.  The dialect can be found in many historically important literary works for the Macedonian literature.  One of the most important is \u01f4or\u01f5ija Puleski and his dictionary of three languages.\n\n7. \u0112ostre or Ostara (Old English: \"\u0112astre\" ] , Northumbrian dialect \"\u0112ostre \" ] ; Old High German: \"*\u00d4stara\" (reconstructed form)) is a Germanic goddess who, by way of the Germanic month bearing her name (Northumbrian: \"\u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe \"; West Saxon: \"\u0112asterm\u014dna\u00fe \"; Old High German: \"\u00d4starm\u00e2noth\" ), is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages.  \u0112ostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work \"The Reckoning of Time\", where Bede states that during \"\u0112osturm\u014dna\u00fe \" (the equivalent of April), pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in \u0112ostre's honor, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\n\n8. Northumbrian was a dialect of Old English spoken in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria.  Together with Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon, it forms one of the sub-categories of Old English devised and employed by modern scholars.\n\n9. Here Northumbria is taken to mean Northumberland, the northernmost county of England, and County Durham.  This area, together with Tweeddale, was the ancient British tribal kingdom of Bernicia (Bryneich) and is notable for the stable ancestry of its present indigenous population, which has been identified by DNA analysis to be an offshoot of the group Scotland, Cumbria and the North of Ireland, but not so closely related to the other peoples of the UK.  The area was the core of the outstanding artistic culture that developed during the Northumbrian Golden Age of the 7th and 8th centuries; it would be unwise to suggest that the area did not have a flourishing musical culture at that time, or that it was not of similar sophistication - Bede makes reference to the playing of the harp.  The traditional music of this area may be a tangible legacy of the Bernicians - given that little is known of the antiquity of Northumbrian music; though traditional Northumbrian instruments would have had their limitations.  However, much surviving early modern Northumbrian music is similar in form to the music of the Scottish Lowlands, so Northumberland's position on the cultural frontier between England and Scotland has played a significant role.  The modern era has seen Northumbrian traditional music artificially pigeon holed into national divisions, into which Northumbrian music simply will not fit.  Likewise, the crude assumption that the font of all music of substance was in the west and north of the British isles has undermined considered appreciation of the local repertoire.The region possesses a distinctive style of folk music with a strong and continuing tradition.  The region is particularly noted for its tradition of border ballads, the Northumbrian smallpipe (a form of bagpipe unique to north-east England) and also a strong fiddle tradition in the region that was already well established in the 1690s.  Northumbrian music is characterised by considerable influence from other regions (and vice versa), particularly southern Scotland and other parts of the north of England.  Irish tunes are also much played in the region, as they are elsewhere.  There has been a continuous tradition of traditional and distinctive Northumbrian styles since the 18th century \u2013 there have also been 'revivals' in the late nineteenth century and again in the mid-twentieth.  More recently, Northumbrian folk music, and particularly the use of the Northumbrian pipes, has become one of the liveliest and most widely known forms of folk music in Britain.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The Kingdom of Northumbria ( ; Old English: \"Nor\u00fehymbra r\u012bce\" , \"kingdom of the Northumbrians\") was a medieval Anglian kingdom in what is now northern England and south-east Scotland, which subsequently became an earldom in a unified English kingdom.
