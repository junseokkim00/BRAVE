The second and third go into more detail about how he has to change and what he will never be able to do.  The main theme for the whole of the trilogy is insecurity.

The .308 Norma Magnum (7.62\u00d765mmBR) cartridge was created by Nils Kvale at Norma, Sweden.  Like the larger .358 Norma Magnum it is based on the .300 H&H Magnum.  The length of the case is the longest that would fit in a standard Mauser action.  While it appeared to have a bright future initially, it was soon superseded in popularity by the .300 Winchester Magnum.  The first, and one of the few, manufacturers to offer rifles in .308 Norma Magnum was Schultz & Larsen of Denmark and they still are.\n\n1. The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.  It is sometimes referred to as a \"Combat Magnum\".  It was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum.  Now discontinued, the Colt Python targeted the premium revolver market segment.  Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy Thompson, Scott Wolber, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made.\n\n2. The .300 Winchester Magnum (also known as .300 Win Mag or 300WM) (7.62\u00d767mm) is a belted, bottlenecked magnum rifle cartridge that was introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1963.  The .300 Winchester Magnum is a magnum cartridge designed to fit in a standard rifle action.  It is based on the .375 H&H Magnum, which has been blown out, shortened, and necked down to accept a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) bullet.\n\n3. The .256 Winchester Magnum was a firearms cartridge developed by Winchester, and was produced by necking-down a .357 Magnum cartridge to .257 diameter.  It was designed for shooting small game and varmints. Introduced in 1960, Winchester offered ammo and reloading components into the early 1990s.  The cartridge was first chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye single shot pistol.  The next year (1962) Marlin chambered their Model 62 Levermatic rifle for the new Winchester cartridge.  These were the two principal firearms chambered for the .256 Win.  Mag.  It is now obsolete and only offered as a chambering by custom manufacturers of single-shot firearm barrels such as Match Grade Machine and Bullberry.  Previously, the T/C Custom Shop had produced some, before closing its doors forever in 2010.\n\n4. The .300 Norma Magnum is a cartridge that has begun to gain popularity in the long range shooting community.  The .300 Norma Magnum is a .338 Norma Magnum case necked down to .308 caliber.  This cartridge was named .300 Norma Magnum to differentiate it from the .308 Norma Magnum designed in 1960.  The United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has selected .300 Norma Magnum as their new Advanced Sniper Rifle Cartridge (2016).\n\n5. The 6.5mm Creedmoor, also called the 6.5 Creedmoor or 6.5 CM for short, is a centerfire rifle cartridge introduced by Hornady in 2007 as a modification of the .30 TC, which was based on the .308 Winchester.  It was designed specifically for rifle target shooting, although it is also achieving success in game hunting.  Bullet for bullet, the 6.5mm Creedmoor achieves a slower muzzle velocity than longer cartridges such as the 6.5-284 Norma or magnum cartridges such as the 6.5mm Remington Magnum.  However, due to its 2.825 in overall length, it is capable of being chambered in short-action bolt action rifles and AR-10 semi-automatic rifles.\n\n6. Chase the Dragon is the third studio album by English rock band Magnum.  It was released in 1982 on Jet Records.  Overseen by the Kansas producer Jeff Glixman, \"Chase the Dragon\" was the first recorded appearance by the new keyboard player Mark Stanway, although he had made his live debut at Magnum's appearance at the Reading Festival in 1980.  The album was recorded over 13 days at Town House Studios in London, and the following year Tony Clarkin flew to Axis Studios in Atlanta to mix it.  However, there was a two-year delay before the album's release in 1982.  Many of the tracks have remained in Magnum's live set for many years, including \"Soldier of the Line\", \"The Spirit\" and \"Sacred Hour\".\n\n7. The .358 Norma Magnum (.358 NM or 9.1x64mmBR) is a bolt action rifle cartridge introduced in 1959 by Swedish company, Norma.  It is closely related to the smaller-bullet .308 Norma Magnum.  Both calibers share the same dimensions of the case head as the .300 H&H Magnum, but have far less body taper, resulting in the same internal capacity in a shorter case.  The cartridge case is the longest that will comfortably fit in a standard Mauser action, or any rifle action designed to chamber the 30-06.  The .358 NM was the first .35 caliber cartridge commercially developed and sold to the American market since the decline of the .35 Newton in the late 1920s.\n\n8. The .338 Norma Magnum is a cartridge first introduced in 2008 and came into production in 2009, designed by Norma of Sweden.\n\n9. The Sako TRG is a bolt-action sniper rifle line designed and manufactured by the Finnish firearm manufacturer, SAKO of Riihim\u00e4ki.  The TRG-21 and TRG-22 are designed to fire standard .308 Winchester or 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge, while the TRG-41 and TRG-42 are designed to fire the more powerful .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge and therefore having a standard larger action and barrel.  They are available with olive drab green, desert tan/coyote brown, dark earth or black stocks, and are also available with a folding stock.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The 6.5mm Creedmoor, also called the 6.5 Creedmoor or 6.5 CM for short, is a centerfire rifle cartridge introduced by Hornady in 2007 as a modification of the .30 TC, which was based on the .308 Winchester.  It was designed specifically for rifle target shooting, although it is also achieving success in game hunting.  Bullet for bullet, the 6.5mm Creedmoor achieves a slower muzzle velocity than longer cartridges such as the 6.5-284 Norma or magnum cartridges such as the 6.5mm Remington Magnum.  However, due to its 2.825 in overall length, it is capable of being chambered in short-action bolt action rifles and AR-10 semi-automatic rifles.\n\nThe .256 Winchester Magnum was a firearms cartridge developed by Winchester, and was produced by necking-down a .357 Magnum cartridge to .257 diameter.  It was designed for shooting small game and varmints. Introduced in 1960, Winchester offered ammo and reloading components into the early 1990s.  The cartridge was first chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye single shot pistol.  The next year (1962) Marlin chambered their Model 62 Levermatic rifle for the new Winchester cartridge.  These were the two principal firearms chambered for the .256 Win.  Mag.  It is now obsolete and only offered as a chambering by custom manufacturers of single-shot firearm barrels such as Match Grade Machine and Bullberry.  Previously, the T/C Custom Shop had produced some, before closing its doors forever in 2010.\n\nThe .308 Norma Magnum (7.62\u00d765mmBR) cartridge was created by Nils Kvale at Norma, Sweden.  Like the larger .358 Norma Magnum it is based on the .300 H&H Magnum.  The length of the case is the longest that would fit in a standard Mauser action.  While it appeared to have a bright future initially, it was soon superseded in popularity by the .300 Winchester Magnum.  The first, and one of the few, manufacturers to offer rifles in .308 Norma Magnum was Schultz & Larsen of Denmark and they still are.\n\nThe .300 Winchester Magnum (also known as .300 Win Mag or 300WM) (7.62\u00d767mm) is a belted, bottlenecked magnum rifle cartridge that was introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1963.  The .300 Winchester Magnum is a magnum cartridge designed to fit in a standard rifle action.  It is based on the .375 H&H Magnum, which has been blown out, shortened, and necked down to accept a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) bullet.\n\nThe .300 Norma Magnum is a cartridge that has begun to gain popularity in the long range shooting community.  The .300 Norma Magnum is a .338 Norma Magnum case necked down to .308 caliber.  This cartridge was named .300 Norma Magnum to differentiate it from the .308 Norma Magnum designed in 1960.  The United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has selected .300 Norma Magnum as their new Advanced Sniper Rifle Cartridge (2016).\n\nThe .338 Norma Magnum is a cartridge first introduced in 2008 and came into production in 2009, designed by Norma of Sweden.\n\nThe Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.  It is sometimes referred to as a \"Combat Magnum\".  It was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum.  Now discontinued, the Colt Python targeted the premium revolver market segment.  Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy Thompson, Scott Wolber, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made.\n\n", "chosen_titles": [".300 Norma Magnum", ".300 Winchester Magnum", "Sako TRG", "Colt Python", ".256 Winchester Magnum", ".358 Norma Magnum", ".308 Norma Magnum"], "gold_chosen_titles": [".308 Norma Magnum", ".300 Winchester Magnum"], "correct": true}

Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera is an English musical with book, music, and lyrics by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall written for the Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol, England.  The show is based on a series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot, a New York City alley cat, a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake.  It had been intended for children, but when told by a New York City literary agent that \u201cNo mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the alley cat, never mind its name,\u201d the story went into a drawer for many years.  It came out with the meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki, at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian's son Rupert Stanshall (born 1968), and later for his daughter with Ki, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall (born 1979).

A trellis (treillage) is an architectural structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of interwoven or intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made to support and display climbing plants, especially shrubs.  There are many types of trellis for different places and for different plants, from agricultural types, especially in viticulture, which are covered at vine training systems, to garden uses for climbers such as grapevines, clematis, ivy, and climbing roses or other support based growing plants.  The rose trellis is especially common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties require a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants.  Some plants will climb and wrap themselves round a trellis without much artificial help being needed while others need training by passing the growing shoots through the trellis and/or tying them to the framework.\n\n7. The Middletown Nature Gardens is located off Randolph Road in Middletown, Connecticut.  In 1995, the city of Middletown, CT purchased the 18 acre of land and dedicated it open space.

Some of the types of trees and shrubs include red cedar, flowering dogwood, highbush blueberries, white pine, and speckled alder.  The main trail is a 0.5 mi loop.  Mulched side trails, which branch off the main trail, add another 0.5 mi to walk.  Community volunteers maintain the park.  They have erected many bluebird boxes and bat houses to house some of the natural wildlife of the park.  There are also vernal pools, which are habitats for salamanders and wood frogs in the southeast corner of the park.

Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n4. \"Elgin State Bank\" in Elgin, IL is a private company categorized under Banks and Financial Institutions.

A savings and loan association (S&L), or thrift institution, is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings, deposits, and making mortgage and other loans.

They are often mutually held (often called mutual savings banks ), meaning that the depositors and borrowers are members with voting rights, and have the ability to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organization like the members of a credit union or the policyholders of a mutual insurance company.  While it is possible for an S&L to be a joint-stock company, and even publicly traded; in such instances it is no longer truly a mutual association, and depositors and borrowers no longer have membership rights and managerial control.  By law, thrifts can have no more than 20 percent of their lending in commercial loans \u2014 their focus on mortgage and consumer loans makes them particularly vulnerable to housing downturns such as the deep one the U.S. has experienced since 2007.\n\n8.

A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization.  Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending.  Building societies exist in the United Kingdom (UK), and used to exist in Ireland and several Commonwealth countries.  They are similar to credit unions in organisation, though few enforce a common bond.  However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, the purpose of a building society is to provide home mortgages to members.  Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis.  Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans.  The term \"building society\" first arose in the 18th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "A savings and loan association (S&L), or thrift institution, is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings, deposits, and making mortgage and other loans.

Hate crime laws in the United States are state and federal laws intended to protect against hate crimes (also known as \"bias crimes\") motivated by enmity or animus against a protected class of persons.  Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)/FBI, as well as campus security authorities, are required to collect and publish hate crime statistics.\n\n2.

A character (sometimes known as a fictional character) is a person or other being in a narrative work of art (such as a novel, play, television series, or film).  The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a \"fictional\" versus \"real\" character may be made.  Derived from the ancient Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in \"Tom Jones\" in 1749.  From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed.  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person.\"  In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.  Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor.  Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.\n\n4.

The beginning of the end of the leaders who were not noble to the citizens and disobeyed the Republic which came when the brothers Gracchi challenged the traditional constitutional order in the 130s and 120s BC.  Though members of the aristocracy themselves, they sought to parcel out public land to the dispossessed Italian peasant farmers.  Other measures followed, but many senators feared the Gracchi's policy and both brothers met violent deaths.  The next champion of the people was the great general Gaius Marius; he departed from established practice by recruiting his soldiers not only from landed citizens but from landless citizens, including the growing urban proletariat.  These were people who when the wars were over, looked to their commander for a more permanent reward in the shape of land of their own.  Thus the situation developed where commanders and their armies banded together in pursuit of political objectives, the commanders seeking power and the soldiers rewards.\n\n2. Manius Acilius Glabrio was a Roman Senator who served as consul ordinarius in AD 91 as the colleague of Trajan, afterwards emperor.

The Battle of the Colline Gate, fought on the Kalends of November, 82 BC, was the final battle of the second civil war between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Marians.  Sulla won and secured control of Rome and Italy.  Appian is the only source who provides details about the battle.  Much of the war was fought in northern Italy.  The Lucanians, the Samnites and the Gauls fought alongside the Marians.  Following defection of the Gauls to the forces of Sulla and the defeat of some of his forces by Lucullus (one of Sulla's lieutenants) near Placentia (Piacenza), Carbo, the leader of the Marians, fled to Africa.  His lieutenants, Gaius Carrinas, Gaius Marcius Censorinus and Damasippus tried to force their way though a pass controlled by Sulla's men with all their forces and with the Samnites.  This failed and they marched on Rome.  Sulla sent his cavalry ahead to hinder their march and went to Rome with his army.  He encamped at the Colline Gate.  The enemy was already encamped nearby.  In the ensuing battle Sulla won on the right wing, but the left wing was defeated and fled to the gates pursued by the enemy.  The soldiers guarding the gate dropped the portcullis (a heavy grating which can be lowered to block the gate) when they saw the rush to the gate, killing many soldiers and many senators.  The rest of the Sullans turned and fought the enemy.  The battle continued through the night.  Gaius Carrinas, a Marian commander, and Pontius Telesinus, the Samnite commander, were killed and their camp was seized.  Eventually, the enemy fled.  The death toll was estimated at 50,000.  There were 8,000 prisoners.  They were shot down by darts because they were mostly Samnites.  Marcius, Carrinas and Marcus Lamponius, the Lucanian, fled.  Marcius and Carrinas were captured and brought in the next day.  Sulla killed them.  He sent his lieutenant, Lucretius, to show their heads before the walls of Praeneste (Palestrina), where Gaius Marius the Younger was besieged.  Velleius Paterculus wrote that Sulla ordered the head of Telesinus to be carried around the walls of Praeneste fixed on top of a spear.  He did not mention Marcius and Carrinas.\n\n6.

Bio-diplomacy is involved in enhancing international cooperation in environmental issues and actively supports efforts to maintain biological and cultural diversity.

Bio-diplomacy is the diplomacy that adopts the principle of defense for bios as the primary national and international priority.  Professor Vlavianos Arvanitis highlights that the pursuit of bio-diplomacy in a coordinated fashion at the international, national, regional, and local levels, will provide for increased cooperation among people across the globe and can encourage international cooperation in environmental protection in issues such as the mitigation of climate change, management of pollution, management of water resources, forests and oceans.Bio-diplomacy recognizes that cultural differentiation constitutes the wealth of the body of humanity, which is part of the body of bios, where DNA, the genetic code for every living organism is the link connecting all forms of life.\n\n2.

Written in a stream of consciousness narrative, the story is told in a series of bi-polar rants by Rivers, and chronicles his thoughts in non-linear sequences from childhood through his adult life.

The \"curse\" supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game.  The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.\n\n1.

Fess Elisha Parker Jr. (August 16, 1924 \u2013 March 18, 2010) was an American film and television actor best known for his portrayals of Davy Crockett in the Walt Disney 1955\u20131956 TV miniseries and as Daniel Boone in a television series from 1964 to 1970.  He was also known as a winemaker and resort owner-operator.\n\n3. Anipamil is a calcium channel blocker, specifically of the phenylalkylamine type.  This type is separate from its more common cousin Dihydropyridine.  Anipamil is an analog of the more common drug verapamil, which is the most common type of phenylalkylamine style calcium channel blocker.  Anipamil has been shown to be a more effective antiarrhythmic medication than verapamil because it does not cause hypertension as seen in verapamil.  It is able to do this by bonding to the myocardium tighter then verapamil.\n\n4. The term mass media refers to any means or technology used to communicate a message to large groups of people.  Popular forms of mass media include television, the Internet, and newspapers.  Mass media are specifically intended to reach larger audiences.  The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic mass media and that of print mass media.  Electronic mass media require their audiences to interact with electronics in order to receive the message.  They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound.  Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet.  Print mass media, on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper.  Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines.  The mass media model in Canada is different from the mass media model of the United States as well as the rest of the world.  According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States.  Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media.  In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that \"most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.\"  Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media.  These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community.  Mass media help in forming a community through communication.  When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed.  Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity.\n\n5. The portrayal of the family structure in the media is important because the media reinforces different gender stereotypes in society today.  The media tends to highlight the \"traditional American family\" as opposed to nonconventional configurations.  Social Scientists have found that home, family and romance are three of the most important components of the way characters are presented.  Moreover, these qualities are often presented in a stereotypical and traditional fashion.  In the past few years, the traditional American family has shifted from its original patriarchal structure to a more gender-equivalent dynamic.  For example, two-married-parent families were the most common type of family unit a generation ago; however, in the year 2000 that particular family structure could only be found in one out of four households.  The depictions of these changes in the media can reinforce or debunk society's views on raising a family.  Media channels such as children's books, television, movies and advertisements are direct touch points for both youth and parents to process shifting gender roles within the family.  More specifically, as roles such as \"dumb\" fathers, single mothers, step mothers and stay-at-home dads continue to be portrayed in the media, these roles will mirror and shift in reality as well.\n\n6. Uterine cancer or womb cancer is any type of cancer that emerges from the tissue of the uterus.  It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries.  Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.  Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer.  Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop.  If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods.  When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.\n\n7. Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing.  There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A).  A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)).  The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B).  There are another 8 alleles reported in BGMUT, the most discovered reciently in China and Taiwan.  In the cis-AB genotype, both antigens are expressed, like in a standard (trans) AB genotype.  In a traditional AB phenotype, A and B antigenes are inherited separately from the father and mother while a cis-AB allele comes from one parent only.  In a serum test, cis-AB tests almost the same as a traditional AB, but people with this rare type have problems with blood transfusions.  Some of them need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood.\n\n8. In DVD authoring, a write strategy is a set of low-level parameters that enables an optical disc drive to write on a specific type of blank media according to its optimum specifications.  The media type is identified by the manufacturer and media ID, which is often unrelated to the brand of the media due to rebadging.  Write strategies are essential for compatibility with various types of blank media, and are typically stored in the drive's firmware.  If a drive lacks a write strategy for a media type, it will only be able to write using minimum speed.  Drive manufacturers typically include new or improved write strategies as part of a firmware upgrade, in order to extend or improve compatibility with blank media.  In cases where official support for a drive has been discontinued or is deemed unsatisfactory, users have come up with ways to patch the write strategies by modding the drive's firmware.\n\n9. Skin cancer, or neoplasia, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in horses, accounting for 45 to 80% of all cancers diagnosed.  Sarcoids are the most common type of skin neoplasm and are the most common type of cancer overall in horses.  Squamous-cell carcinoma is the second-most prevalent skin cancer, followed by melanoma.  Squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma usually occur in horses greater than 9-years-old, while sarcoids commonly affect horses 3 to 6 years old.  Surgical biopsy is the method of choice for diagnosis of most equine skin cancers, but is contraindicated for cases of sarcoids.  Prognosis and treatment effectiveness varies based on type of cancer, degree of local tissue destruction, evidence of spread to other organs (metastasis) and location of the tumor.  Not all cancers metastasize and some can be cured or mitigated by surgical removal of the cancerous tissue or through use of chemotherapeutic drugs.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "The term mass media refers to any means or technology used to communicate a message to large groups of people.

A film genre is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.).  Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism.  The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama.  Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama.  Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \"Evil Dead\" films.  Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film.\n\n1. Li Yang (; born 1969 in Changzhou, Jiangsu) is a Chinese educator and language instructor.  He is the creator of \"Crazy English\", an unorthodox method of teaching English.  He claimed to have taught English to more than 20 million people in a decade.\n\n2. Andrea Morricone (born 10 October 1964) is an Italian composer and conductor, known for his film scores.  He is the son of composer Ennio Morricone.  He composed the film scores for the American films \"Capturing the Friedmans\" and \"Liberty Heights\".  He collaborated with his father on the famous score for \"Cinema Paradiso\", for which they won a BAFTA Award.  He has also composed music for many other Italian films.\n\n3. The woman's film is a film genre which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience.  Woman's films usually portray \"women's concerns\" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and romance.  These films were produced from the silent era through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during World War II.  Although Hollywood continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s.  The work of directors George Cukor, Douglas Sirk, Max Oph\u00fcls, and Josef von Sternberg has been associated with the woman's film genre.  Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck were some of the genre's most prolific stars.\n\n4. Andrew Jarecki is an American filmmaker, musician, and entrepreneur.

He is also known for the documentary film \"Capturing the Friedmans\", which won eighteen international prizes including the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and the New York Film Critics Circle award, and was nominated for an Academy Award.  He also co-founded Moviefone and created the KnowMe iOS platform.\n\n5. Debbie Nathan (born 1950) is an American feminist journalist and writer, with a focus on cultural and criminal justice issues concerning abuse of children, particularly accusations of satanic ritual abuse in schools and child care institutions.  She also writes about immigration, focusing on women and on dynamics between immigration and sexuality.  Nathan's writing has won a number of awards.  She appears in the 2003 Oscar-nominated film \"Capturing the Friedmans\".  She has been affiliated with the National Center for Reason and Justice, which, among other things, provides support to persons who may have been wrongly accused of sexual abuse.\n\n6. OP Eiga (\u30aa\u30fc\u30d4\u30fc\u6620\u753b ) , also known as \u014ckura Eiga (\u5927\u8535\u6620\u753b ) is the largest and one of the oldest independent Japanese studios which produce and distribute pink films. Along with Shint\u014dh\u014d Eiga, Kant\u014d, Million Film, and K\u014dji Wakamatsu's production studio, \u014ckura was one of the most influential studios on the pink film genre.  Among the many notable pink films released by the studio are Satoru Kobayashi's \"Flesh Market\" (1962), the first film in the pink film genre.\n\n7. Capturing the Friedmans is a 2003 HBO documentary film directed by Andrew Jarecki.  It focuses on the 1980s investigation of Arnold and Jesse Friedman for child molestation.

The film premiered along with Zhang's \"Seventeen Years\" at the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival.  It established Zhang's position as a \"legitimate\" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese authorities.\n\n9. The actuality film is a non-fiction film genre that, like the documentary film, uses footage of real events, places, and things, yet unlike the documentary is not structured into a larger argument, picture of the phenomenon or coherent whole.  In practice, actuality films preceded the emergence of the documentary.  During the era of early cinema, actualities\u2014usually lasting no more than a minute or two and usually assembled together into a program by an exhibitor\u2014were just as popular and prominent as their fictional counterparts.  The line between \"fact\" and \"fiction\" was not so sharply drawn in early cinema as it would become after the documentary came to serve as the predominant non-fiction filmmaking form.  An actuality film is not like a newspaper article so much as it is like the still photograph that is published along with the article, with the major difference being that it moves.  Apart from the traveling actuality genre, actuality is one film genre that remains strongly related to still photography.\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Andrew Jarecki is an American filmmaker, musician, and entrepreneur.

It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects.  The Smashing Pumpkins opened at the Dodger Stadium show only, in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance.  The Dodger Stadium show was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast.  Two songs, \"Psycho Circus\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\", were screened live on Fox television as part of the \"Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party\" special.  The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour.  Peter Criss was quoted in Metal Edge magazine at the time as wanting to add \"Parasite\" to the setlist.  The tour was initially hyped as having circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment.  This ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium.  Peter Criss later said that it didn't work out because the circus performers wanted equal billing and that some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room.  \"2,000 Man\" was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver, advertised at the time as being recorded for Alive IV.  The Vancouver show was also notable as being the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert \u2013 \"I Love It Loud\", \"Lick It Up\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour.  \"Forever\" was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played.  It was thought at the time it may have been intended as a Paul Stanley solo version prior to \"Black Diamond\".  One notable show on the tour was the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show.

Production of the Century began in 1967 and the model received only minor changes until a redesign in 1997.  The Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries.  The Century was available with only a V8 engine, the third Japanese built sedan post-war, at its introduction in 1967 until a major redesign in 1997, and is now only available with a Toyota built V12, an engine unique to the Century.

It was the counterpart of the Corona EXiV.  Its design sought to emulate the hardtop four-door coup\u00e9 styling of large American and European sedans, resulting in a small, low cabin with longer front and rear ends.  The ED's B-pillar stood up in the middle with no purpose other than to hinge the rear door on; it was not attached to the roof side of the cabin.  The ED achieved huge sales in Japan, and other Japanese manufacturers introduced the Mazda Persona, Nissan Presea, and Mitsubishi Emeraude around the same time.  \"ED\" is the initials of \"Exciting\" and \"Dressy\".

Umbrella branding (also known as family branding) is a marketing practice involving the use of a single brand name for the sale of two or more related products.  Umbrella branding is mainly used by companies with a positive brand equity (value of a brand in a certain marketplace).  All products use the same means of identification and lack additional brand names or symbols.  This marketing practice differs from brand extension in that umbrella branding involves the marketing of similar products, rather than differentiated products, under one brand name.  Hence, umbrella branding may be considered as a type of brand extension.  The practice of umbrella branding does not disallow a firm to implement different branding approaches for different product lines (e.g. brand extension).\n\n5.

Individual branding is a type of branding strategy contrasting with family branding, corporate branding, and umbrella branding, where the firm markets all of its product together, using the same brand name and identity.  All kind of branding strategies are highly related to economic and social factors, as well as to the nature of business and consumers' needs.\n\n6.

Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics, sometimes referred to as The Brainwashing Manual, is a book published by the Church of Scientology in 1955.  It purports to be a condensation of the work of Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief.  The book states Kenneth Goff as author.  Its true authorship is not clear, the three common hypotheses being: Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, Kenneth Goff (alias Oliver Kenneth Goff), or both L Ron Hubbard and Kenneth Goff based on an acquired US agency report.  The third hypothesis is questionable as there is not proof that the two men ever knew each other.  Claims that L Ron Hubbard was the author are also dubious as the only source of this claim is his estranged son, L Ron Hubbard Jr., who made it his life work trying to intentionally discredit his father in every possible way, and in addition to withdrawing all his accusations before his death, has been discredited in courts of law.\n\n2.

He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology.  His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.  The Church's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the most translated and published author in the world.  The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard.

After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950.  He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology.  His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation.  The Church's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the most translated and published author in the world.  The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard.  In 2014, Hubbard was cited by \"Smithsonian\" magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time, as one of the eleven religious figures on that list.\n\n", "chosen_titles": ["Brain-Washing (book)", "Bare-faced Messiah"], "gold_chosen_titles": ["Anne Frank", "L.

The 1978 Green Bay Packers season was their 59th season in the National Football League.  The club posted an 8\u20137\u20131 record under coach Bart Starr, earning them a second-place finish in the NFC Central division.  This marked the first season the Packers were above .500 since 1972.  The Packers got off to a 6-1 start.  However, most of the wins came against weaker teams, and once the scheduled toughened up the Packers struggled winning only one and tying one of their next six games.  After a big win in Tampa Bay over the Buccaneers, the 8-5-1 Packers still had a shot at a NFC Central Title.  However, the team would lose both of their final games, closing out with a 31-14 loss to the Los Angeles Rams and at 8-7-1 finished in a first place tie .

Maclear's rat (\"Rattus macleari\") was a large rat which lived on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.  Abundant, unfamiliar with and seemingly unafraid of humans, large numbers of the creatures emerged and foraged in all directions at night.  Making querulous squeaks, the rats entered the \"Challenger\" Expedition's tents and shelters, ran over sleepers, and upset everything in the search and fight for food.  Maclear's rat may have been responsible for keeping the population of the Christmas Island red crab in check, as recent numbers of the crab are greater than in the past.  It is thought that black rats inadvertently introduced by the expedition infected the Maclear's rats with a disease (possibly a trypanosome), which in turn may have contributed to the species decline.  The last recorded sighting was in 1903, although it is possible that Maclear's rats formed hybrids with black rats.  A hard tick, \"Ixodes nitens\", described as an ectoparasite of Maclear's rat is also thought to be extinct.\n\n7.

The Packers came into the 2013 season looking to win the NFC North for the 3rd year in a row.  They were coming off a 45-31 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs.  The Packers started the 2013 season with a rematch with the 49ers in San Francisco.  They lost the game 34-28.  After winning their home opener against the Redskins, they lost 34-30 in Cincinnati to the Bengals after they had a 30-14 lead in the 3rd quarter.  After the loss, the Packers would win 4 games in a row to sit at 5-2 before losing a Monday Night game at home to the Bears 27-20.  In that game, the Packers would lose star quarterback Aaron Rodgers to a broken collarbone in the 1st quarter.  He would be replaced by Scott Tolzien and sometimes Matt Flynn.  In week 12, the Packers tied the Vikings 26-26.  It was Green Bay's first tie since 1987.  The Packers would lose the next game 40-10 to the Lions on Thanksgiving to sit at 5-6-1, and looking like being on the verge of missing the postseason for the first time since 2008.  The Packers would then beat the Falcons 22-21 to even their record at 6-6-1.  The following week, the Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 37-36 in Dallas after they had trailed 26-3 at halftime.  The comeback was the largest in franchise history.  The Packers would then lose a shootout with the Pittsburgh Steelers 38-31 at home to sit at 7-7-1, the first meeting between the teams since Super Bowl XLV.  The next week, the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears 33-28 at Soldier Field to clinch the NFC North in a game in which the winner would've clinched the division.  The game was famously well known for a touchdown catch made by Randall Cobb from Aaron Rodgers with less than a minute remaining to seal the win.  The play came on a 4th and 8 situation in which Cobb was wide open near the endzone.  The Packers entered the playoffs as the 4 seed in the NFC.  In the wild card game, they lost 23-20 in a rematch with the 49ers on a Phil Dawson field goal as time expired.  The game was one of the coldest in NFL playoff history, with a final temperature of 5\u00a0\u00b0F (-15\u00a0\u00b0C)\n\n", "fine_grained_context": "Daniel \"Danny\" Ocean is a fictional character in the original \"Ocean's 11\", its 2001 remake \"Ocean's Eleven\", and the two films that followed the remake (\"Ocean's Twelve\" in 2004 and \"Ocean's Thirteen\" in 2007).

Although there are numerous oil companies operating in Canada, the majority of production, refining and marketing is done by fewer than 20 of them.  According to the 2013 edition of Forbes Global 2000, canoils.com and any other list that emphasizes market capitalization and revenue when sizing up companies, as of March 31, 2014 these are the largest Canada-based oil and gas companies (they are either based entirely in Canada or majority Canadian owned).  However more recent changes, possibly mergers or a stronger showing in the price of oil could mean a few of the oil sands producers are underrepresented; this is because Canadian companies are increasingly dependent on production from that source, which is hurt severely when oil prices decline below 50 to 60 dollars a barrel since costs per barrel traditionally exceed $28 and non-upgraded bitumen (<10 API) produces 1.7 fewer barrels per metric ton than West Texas Intermediate oil (according to calculation).  A few of the larger companies (Penn West Petroleum and Athabasca Oil Corporation) don't show up in the Forbes list because its ranking system takes many different factors into account.\n\n7.

The Republican nominee for President was Bob Dole, the former Republican Leader of the United States Senate and long-time Senator from Kansas who was previously the vice-presidential running mate of President Gerald Ford in 1976, following Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's retirement from politics that year.  Dole's running mate for Vice President was Jack Kemp, a former NFL football player and the Housing Secretary under George H. W. Bush.

The 1840 Democratic National Convention was held in Baltimore.  The Democrats nominated President Martin Van Buren for reelection in 1840 in spite of his unpopularity following the Panic of 1837.  Vice President Richard M. Johnson was not retained on the ticket, as he was largely seen as a liability in the 1836 election and had focused much of his time as vice president on his own economic affairs.  Former President Andrew Jackson backed James K. Polk for the position of vice president, but Van Buren supported his vice president's renomination.

McDonough in 1979, Maguire ran for the State Senate, but lost a vote of a Republican convention to DiFrancesco.  He was re-elected to the Assembly, with future Congressman Bob Franks as his running mate.  Maguire's political career came to an end in 1981, when redistricting traded Democratic towns in Union County for solid Republican towns in Essex County.  DiFrancesco was facing a primary challenge from an Essex County Republican; to secure the Essex organization line in a district where Republican primary election voters were evenly split between Essex and Union, DiFrancesco agreed to put an Essex Republican on his ticket.  John Renna, the Essex Republican Chairman, preferred that Franks (who had worked on Renna's 1977 bid for County Chairman), get the second Assembly seat.

Slotback (sometimes referred to as an A-back or, especially in the United States, slot receiver) is a position in gridiron football.  The \"slot\" is the area between the last offensive lineman on either side of the center and the wide receiver on that side.  A player who lines up between those two players and behind the line of scrimmage is a slotback.  The position is a fixture of Canadian football and indoor football, but is also used in American football.  The slotback is similar to the wide receiver but also has many of the same traits as a running back or tight end; a slotback lines up closer to the offensive line and often farther back than a wide receiver.\n\n9.

The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 Jews is a non-fiction book by Peter Duffy, which was published in 2003.  It tells the story of Tuvia Bielski, Alexander Zeisal Bielski(Zus), Aharon Bielski, and Asael Bielski, four Jewish brothers who established a large partisan camp in the forests of Belarus during World War II, and so saved 1,200 Jews from the Nazis.  The book describes how, in 1941, three brothers witnessed their parents and two other siblings being led away to their eventual murders.  The brothers fought back against Germans and collaborators, waging guerrilla warfare in the forests of Belarus.  By using their intimate knowledge of the dense forests surrounding the towns of Lida and Novogrudek, the Bielskis evaded the Nazis and established a hidden base camp, then set about convincing other Jews to join their ranks.  The Germans came upon them once but were unable to get rid of them.  As more Jews arrived each day, a robust community began to emerge; a \"Jerusalem in the woods\".  In July 1944, after some 30 months in the woods, the Bielskis learned that the Germans, overrun by the Red Army, were retreating back toward Berlin.\n\n2. Markus Nissa Weiss, Hungarian advocate of Reform.  In 1792 he had a small business at Pest, and in 1794 he leased an estate near Munk\u00e1cs, where his oppressions gave rise to complaints among the Galician Jews.  In 1802 he published a pamphlet entitled \"Der Jude wie Er Ist,\" in which he pleaded with the Jews to accept the ideas of Reform.  This work caused him to be highly criticized by the Hungarian Jews; and in order to defend his person and ideas he issued (Vienna, 1803) another pamphlet, which was entitled \"Der Bedr\u00e4ngte Markus Nissa Weiss an die Menschen.\"  Finding, however, that he could not overcome the antagonistic attitude of his coreligionists, he embraced Christianity.\n\n3.

The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: \"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one\" (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05e2 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b6\u05d7\u05b8\u05bd\u05d3\u05c3\u200e ), found in , sometimes alternatively translated as \"The LORD is our God, the LORD is one.\"  Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the prayer service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a \"mitzvah\" (religious commandment).  It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their last words, and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.\n\n4. The Karaite Jewish University is a non-profit corporation incorporated in California, U.S.A., in November 2005 for the purposes of disseminating the study of Karaite Judaism.

The university's first \u201cIntroduction to Judaism\u201d class began in February 2006 and ended in May 2007.  Ten of the graduates from the course converted to Judaism together with their children under the auspices of Congregation Bnai Israel of the Karaite Jews of America in Daly City, California, on July 30, 2007.  These were the first official sanctioned conversions to Judaism according to the Karaite rite since 1465.

After the Second World War, with the installation of a new government in Iraq, the situation of the Jews in Iraq deteriorated.  After prominent members of the Jewish community such as Laura Khozoee were arrested, and Shafiq Adas, a successful Jewish businessman, was hanged, many Iraqi Jews decided to emigrate.  Some left for Israel while others decided to settle in Iran.  They reached Iran with the help of Kurdish Jews and many arrived at Khorramshahr.  With the help of Harun Abdolnabi, a prominent Jew in Khorramshahr, some were able to go to Tehran and obtain legal documents.  From 1946 to 1951 many Iraqi Jews moved to Tehran, while others moved to Europe and the United States.  At this time, with the help of Iranian Jews, the Iraqi Jews decided to create a cultural center.  In 1946 Meir Abdullah Batson bought a large piece of land with an area of over 5000 m2 near the University of Tehran, in Ghods Street.  He separated a piece of land of over 865 m2 and turned it into a synagogue, with the help of Saleh and Davood Mashi, Heskel Haim, and others.  The community wanted to name the synagogue after Meir Abdullah, but the government did not accept it because he was a foreign citizen.  Hence the name \"Ettefagh\" was chosen, and it became the main place of gathering for the Iraqi Jews of Tehran.  The synagogue architecture was designed in the style of Babylonian architecture, and it was fitted with the most advanced cooling system of the time.  Most of the Torah scrolls in the synagogue were brought by the Jews who came from Iraq, and a Babylonian Talmud in Aramaic script was dedicated to the synagogue.  Many Iraqi Jews emigrated from Iran during the Iranian revolution, and today only a few families (mainly Iranian Jews) still use the synagogue.\n\n8.

With appropriate academic credentials, some may teach in a college or university equestrian studies program.
