Moidart itself is almost surrounded by bodies of water : Loch Shiel cuts off the eastern boundary of the district (along a south-south-west to north-north-east line), and continues along part of the southern edge; the remainder of the southern edge is cut off by Loch Moidart; the north is cut off by Loch Morar and Loch Ailort.\n\nThe 1994 Pacific typhoon season was an extremely active season in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Western North Pacific, with a total of 32 tropical storms, where 19 of them reached typhoon strength, during the course of the season.  The season had no official bounds and it ran year-round in 1994, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November.  Tropical storms that formed west of the date line were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.  The World Meteorological Organization-designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for tropical cyclones for the region is the Japan Meteorological Agency.  Tropical depressions that entered or formed in the Philippine area of responsibility were assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA.  This resulted in some storms having two names.\n\nEnnore creek is a backwater located in Ennore, Chennai along the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal.  It is located in the zone comprising lagoons with salt marshes and backwaters, submerged under water during high tide and forming an arm of the sea with the opening to the Bay of Bengal at the creek.  The zone is spread over an area of 4\u00a0km, and the creek covers an area of 2.25\u00a0km.  It is located 20\u00a0km north of the city centre and 2.6\u00a0km south of the Ennore Port, and the creek area stretches 3\u00a0km into the sea and 5\u00a0km along the coast.  The creek is nearly 400\u00a0m wide, elongated in northeast-southwest direction and merging with the backwater bodies.  Once a flourishing mangrove swamp, the creek has been degraded to patches in the fringes mainly due to human activities in the region.  The depth of the creek varies from 1 to 2\u00a0m and is shallow near the mouth.  The north\u2013south trending channels of the creek connect it with the Pulicat Lake to the north and to the distributaries of the Kosasthalaiyar River in the south.  The northwestern part of the creek merges with the tidal flats.  The soil in the region is of loamy and alluvial types.  Most of the area consists of tracts of alluvial soil and the eastern region comprises beach dunes, tidal flats and creek.  The creek is oriented from west to east and opens into the Bay of Bengal to the east at Ennore.  The creek acts as an outlet for the excess water from the Poondi Reservoir.  The creek separates the town of Ennore from the Ennore Port located in the north and the Kattupalli Shipyard located further north.  The North Chennai Thermal Power Station is located at the north of the creek and the Ennore Thermal Power Station is located to the south.  The creek is part of the Pulicat water system, including the Pulicat lagoon and the Buckingham Canal.  As per the 1991 Coastal Regulation Zone notification, the entire Pulicat water system is designated CRZ I.  The creek is experiencing siltation due to emergence of the Ennore Port.\n\n", "correct": true}
{"id": 6, "question": "What is the home port for U.S. Navy Fleet ballistic missile nuclear submarines armed with Trident missile nuclear weapons located near SR 40 in Georgia?", "answer": "naval submarine base kings bay", "pred": "naval submarine base kings bay", "original_context": "The RSM-56 Bulava (Russian: \u0411\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 , lit. \" mace\", NATO reporting name SS-NX-30 or SS-N-32 , GRAU index 3M30) is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) developed for the Russian Navy and deployed in 2013 on the new Borei\u00a0class of ballistic missile nuclear submarines.  It is intended as the future cornerstone of Russia's nuclear triad, and is the most expensive weapons project in the country.  The weapon takes its name from \"bulava\", a Russian word for mace.  Bulava has 25% greater range and a 30\u00a0percent lower throw-weight than the 1979 American Trident C4 missile.\n\nAn intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) is a ballistic missile with a range of 3,000\u20135,500\u00a0km (1,864\u20133,418 miles), between a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Classifying ballistic missiles by range is done mostly for convenience; in principle there is very little difference between a low-performance ICBM and a high-performance IRBM, because decreasing payload mass can increase range over ICBM threshold.  The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.  Some other sources include an additional category, the long-range ballistic missile (LRBM), to describe missiles with a range between IRBMs and true ICBMs.  The more modern term theater ballistic missile encompasses MRBMs and SRBMs, including any ballistic missile with a range under 3500 km .\n\nProject Nobska was a 1956 summer study on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) for the United States Navy ordered by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke.  It is also referred to as the Nobska Study, named for its location on Nobska Point near the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  The focus was on the ASW implications of nuclear submarines, particularly on new technologies to defend against them.  The study was coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare (CUW) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).  It was notable for including 73 representatives from numerous organizations involved in submarine design, submarine-related fields, and weapons design, including senior scientists from the Atomic Energy Commission's nuclear weapons laboratories.  Among the participants were Nobel laureate Isidor Rabi, Paul Nitze, and Edward Teller.  The study's recommendations influenced all subsequent US Navy submarine designs, as well as submarine-launched ASW tactical nuclear weapons until this weapon type was phased out in the late 1980s.  Although not on the initial agenda, the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) was determined to be capable of implementation at this conference.  Within five years Polaris would exponentially improve the US Navy's strategic nuclear deterrent capability.\n\nA ballistic missile submarine is a submarine deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads.  The United States Navy's hull classification symbols for ballistic missile submarines are SSB and SSBN \u2013 the \"SS\" denotes submarine (or submersible ship), the \"B\" denotes ballistic missile, and the \"N\" denotes that the submarine is nuclear powered.  These submarines became a major weapon system in the Cold War because of their nuclear deterrence capability.  They can fire missiles thousands of kilometers from their targets, and acoustic quieting makes them difficult to detect (see acoustic signature), thus making them a survivable deterrent in the event of a first strike and a key element of the mutual assured destruction policy of nuclear deterrence.  Their deployment has been dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union / Russia, with smaller numbers in service with France, the United Kingdom, China, and most recently India.\n\nNaval Base Kitsap is a U.S. Navy base located on the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington state.  It was created in 2004 by merging the former Naval Station Bremerton with Naval Submarine Base Bangor.  The Mission of Naval Base Kitsap is to serve as the home base for the Navy\u2019s fleet throughout West Puget Sound and to provide base operating services, including support for both surface ships and Fleet Ballistic Missile and other nuclear submarines having their home ports at Bremerton and Bangor.\n\n41 for Freedom refers to the US Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarines from the \"George Washington\" , \"Ethan Allen\" , \"Lafayette\" , \"James Madison\" , and \"Benjamin Franklin\"\u00a0class es.  All of these submarines were commissioned 1959-1967, as the goal was to create a credible, survivable sea-based deterrent as quickly as possible.  These submarines were nicknamed \"41 for Freedom\" once the goal of 41 nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) was established in the early 1960s.  The 1972 SALT I Treaty limited the number of American submarine-launched ballistic missile tubes to 656, based on the total missile tubes of the forty-one submarines, in line with the treaty's goal of limiting strategic nuclear weapons to the number already existing.\n\nIn nuclear strategy, a counterforce target is one that has a military value, such as a launch silo for intercontinental ballistic missiles, an airbase at which nuclear-armed bombers are stationed, a homeport for ballistic missile submarines, or a command and control installation.  The intent of a counterforce strategy (i.e., attacking counterforce targets with nuclear weapons) is to disarm an adversary by destroying its nuclear weapons before they can be launched, thereby minimizing the impact of a retaliatory second strike.  However, counterforce attacks are also possible in a second strike, especially with weapons like UGM-133 Trident II.  A counterforce target is distinguished from a countervalue target, which includes an adversary's population, knowledge, economic, or political resources.  In other words, a counterforce strike is against an adversary's military while a countervalue strike is against an adversary's cities.  A closely related tactic is the decapitation strike, which by destroying an enemy's nuclear command and control facilities similarly intends to eliminate or reduce their ability to launch a second strike.\n\nState Route 40 (SR 40) is a 30.46 mi state highway in the southeast part of the U.S. state of Georgia.  The highway travels from US 1/US 23/US 301/SR 4/SR 15 in Folkston east to Church Street in St. Marys.  SR 40 is the primary east\u2013west highway of eastern Charlton County and southern Camden County.  The highway connects Folkston and St. Marys with Kingsland, where the route meets Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 17/SR 25.  SR 40 also serves as the majority of the route from I-95 to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay and Cumberland Island National Seashore.  SR 40 has a pair of auxiliary routes: a connector route in Folkston and a spur route in St. Marys that provides access to the submarine base and Crooked River State Park.\n\nThe Trident missile is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV).  Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).  Trident missiles are carried by fourteen US Navy \"Ohio\"-class\u00a0submarine s, with US warheads, and four Royal Navy \"Vanguard\"-class\u00a0submarine s, with British warheads.  The missile is named after the mythological trident of Neptune.\n\nNaval Submarine Base Kings Bay is a base of the United States Navy located adjacent to the town of St. Marys in Camden County, Georgia, in southeastern Georgia, and 38 miles (61 km) from Jacksonville, Florida.  The Submarine Base is the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's home port for U.S. Navy Fleet ballistic missile nuclear submarines armed with Trident missile nuclear weapons.  This submarine base covers about 16,000 acres (6,400 hectares) of land, of which 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) are protected wetlands.\n\n", "correct": true}

Many houses that have courtyards are not courtyard houses of the type covered by this article.  For example, large houses often have small courtyards surrounded by service rooms or corridors, but the main rooms are not disposed around a courtyard.  Blenheim Palace in England is an example of such a house.\n\nEaston Neston is a large grade I listed country house in the parish of Easton Neston near Towcester in Northamptonshire, England.  It was built by William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster (1648-1711), in the Baroque style to the design of the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor.  Easton Neston is thought to be the only mansion which was solely the work of Hawksmoor.  From about 1700, after the completion of Easton Neston, Hawksmoor worked with Sir John Vanbrugh on many buildings, including Castle Howard and Blenheim Palace, and often provided technical knowledge to the less qualified Vanbrugh.  Hawksmoor's work was always more classically severe than Vanbrugh's.  However, Easton Neston predates this partnership by some six years.\n\nSir John Vanbrugh ( ; 24 January 1664 (baptised) \u2013 26 March 1726) was an English architect and dramatist, perhaps best known as the designer of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard.

In the United Kingdom, a listed building is a building or structure of special historical or architectural importance; listing offers the building legal protection against demolition or modification, which requires permission from the local planning authority.  Listed buildings are divided into three categories\u2014grade I, grade II*, and grade II\u2014which reflect the relative significance of the structure and may be a factor in planning decisions.  Grade I is the most significant and accounts for 2.5% of listed buildings, while grade II accounts for 92%.  Grade II* is the intermediate grade accounting for the remaining 5.5%; it is reserved for \"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\".  A war memorial listed at grade II* may be of particular artistic interest or accomplishment, of a highly unusual design, or of significant historical interest below that required for grade I.  It is explicitly unnecessary for the architect or sculptor to be well known in order for a memorial to be listed at grade II*.  As part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Historic England\u2014the government body responsible for listing in England\u2014is running a project with the aim of significantly increasing the number of war memorials on the National Heritage List for England.\n\nThe Atlas Fountain stands in the grounds of Castle Howard, North Yorkshire, England.

The most important building is Appleby Castle; this and a number of associated structures are listed.  Most of the listed buildings are houses and associated structures, shops and public buildings.  Other listed buildings include churches, public houses, hotels, two crosses and a lamp post, farmhouses and farm buildings, former industrial buildings, schools, banks, a bridge, railway station buildings, and a milestone.\n\nFrodsham is a civil parish in Cheshire West and Chester, England.

In the United Kingdom, a listed building is a building or structure of special historical or architectural importance; listing offers the building legal protection against demolition or modification, which requires permission from the local planning authority.  Listed buildings are divided into three categories\u2014grade I, grade II*, and grade II\u2014which reflect the relative significance of the structure and may be a factor in planning decisions.  Grade II accounts for 92% of listed buildings, while grade II* is an intermediate grade accounting for 5.5%; grade I holds the remaining 2.5% of listed buildings and is reserved for structures of exceptional significance.  Grade I listed war memorials are deliberately very few, though several have been upgraded to grade I status as part of commemorations around the First World War centenary.

The station was purchased by Treasure Coast Broadcasters in 2001.  When WSTU went on the air, Stuart went from the biggest city on Florida's east coast without its own radio station to the smallest city on Florida's east coast with its own radio station.  WSTU had a strong local news commitment from the very first, and continues that to this day under News Director Tom Teter, who has been with the station since 1980.  Teter has won many awards for news excellence from UPI and AP including Best Newscast in Florida and Best Spot News Reporting.  From the earliest days the Martin County community viewed the station as more of a public utility than a privately owned radio station.  WSTU was also one of the first radio stations in Florida to broadcast high school sports on a regular basis and continues to broadcast high school football, basketball and baseball.  Hamp Elliot did the play-by-play for many years followed by Teter who handled the play-by-play for more than 20 years.  Rick McGuire now does much of the play-by-play.

Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to \"When Radio Was\").  \"The Mountain 94.9\" carries local high school sports in season.  \"The Mountain 94.9\" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on \"The Mountain 94.9\" during Baseball season).  The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades).  Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located.  The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc.  WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9.  Prior to their \"The Mountain 94.9\" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as \"North Country 95\", airing a full-time Country Music format.  The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent.  Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location).  On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC.  WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates\u2014apart from WLOB\u2014of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show.  WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18\u00bc hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET).  In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk.  In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air).\n\n", "correct": false}

Drummers was a melodic hardcore band formed in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain at the end of 1997 by three teenagers who stood out from their other students due to their colourful hair dies and their taste in the california punk rock bands such as Bad Religion, Operation Ivy, NOFX, Lagwagon, The Descendents etc.  Original members from other small local bands Dani Llamas (guitar and vocals), Pakomoto (Bass and vocals) and Rafa Camison (Drums) started playing together and composing their own music and after one year of sending demos around the country they got put as the opening act for Swedish Punk Rock band Randy on their Spanish tour.  A tour that took the band through the whole country helping a lot of Spanish kids discover that there were actually Spanish bands capable of sounding as good as some of their favorite American bands.  This lead immediately the band to sign to a young record label called Slide Chorus Records a young emerging record label from Madrid which would start releasing albums for other Spanish Punk Rock bands.  This first release titled Proud To Be Nothing hit the streets at the end of 1999 and was presented on their first European tour which covered Spain, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands amongst Spanish punk rock legend[P.P.M.\n\nBeet is the second full-length album by Chicago, Illinois rock band Eleventh Dream Day and their first on a major label, Atlantic Records.\n\nDouglas McCombs (born in 1962 in Peoria, Illinois) plays bass and guitar with the instrumental rock band Tortoise and leads the instrumental band Brokeback.

We recorded 15 songs between 11:00\u00a0pm and 5:00\u00a0am, half of the time spent trying to fix the wild buzz coming out of Rick's amp.  We finally gave up and decided to make amp buzz the theme of the record.\"  The album was re-released and expanded in 2003 by Thrill Jockey.\n\nHaitian rock, or rock krey\u00f2l, started as rock n roll in Haiti in the early 1960s.  It was played by rock bands called \"yeye\" bands.  The name \"yeye\" derives from the Beatles lyrical verse, \"yeah, yeah, yeah\", which took off in the United States and was listened to by upper class Haitian families who had access to the radio.  Young Haitians formed small electric guitar-based bands.

In the fifth year of elementary school, Hirasawa took up the electric guitar, inspired by the surf and instrumental rock bands he heard on the radio and on TV, later joining his junior high school's band.  In 1973 he formed Mandrake, a progressive rock band that incorporated elements from heavy metal and krautrock.  Being one of the few Japanese progressive rock bands of its time, Mandrake achieved little success and released no albums during its lifetime.  After discovering punk rock and working on synthesizer-heavy projects, Hirasawa felt that progressive rock became just for entertainment and decided to reform the band as the electronic rock band P-Model in 1979.  Originally met with success, they turned to decidedly uncommercial post-punk and experimental rock after Hirasawa went through an averse reaction to his fame.  With Hirasawa at the forefront, the band went through various lineups and achieved some popularity in the Japanese independent music scene.\n\n", "correct": true}
{"id": 36, "question": "Which programming language was used to write an application service provider by the same man who created the first computer worm on the internet?", "answer": "lisp", "pred": "lisp", "original_context": "A hosted service provider (xSP) is a business that delivers a combination of traditional IT functions such as infrastructure, applications (software as a service), security, monitoring, storage, web development, website hosting and email, over the Internet or other wide area networks (WAN).  An xSP combines the abilities of an application service provider (ASP) and an Internet service provider (ISP).\n\nViaweb was a web-based application that allowed users to build and host their own online stores with little technical expertise using a web browser.  The company was started in July 1995 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell.  Graham claims Viaweb was the first application service provider.  Viaweb was also unusual for being partially written in the Lisp programming language.\n\nRobert Tappan Morris (born November 8, 1965) is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur.  He is best known for creating the Morris Worm in 1988, considered the first computer worm on the Internet.\n\nLayered Service Provider (LSP) is a deprecated feature of the Microsoft Windows Winsock 2 Service Provider Interface (SPI).  A Layered Service Provider is a DLL that uses Winsock APIs to attempt to insert itself into the TCP/IP protocol stack.  Once in the stack, a Layered Service Provider can intercept and modify inbound and outbound Internet traffic.  It allows processing of all the TCP/IP traffic taking place between the Internet and the applications that are accessing the Internet (such as a web browser, the email client, etc.).  For example, it could be used by malware to redirect web browers to rogue websites, or to block access to sites like Windows Update.  Alternatively, a computer security program could scan network traffic for viruses or other threats.  The Winsock \"Service Provider Interface (SPI)\" API provides a mechanism for layering providers on top of each other.  Winsock LSPs are available for a range of useful purposes, including parental controls and Web content filtering.  The parental controls web filter in Windows Vista is an LSP.  The layering order of all providers is kept in the Winsock Catalog.\n\nCabir (also known as Caribe, SybmOS/Cabir, Symbian/Cabir and EPOC.cabir) is the name of a computer worm developed in 2004 that is designed to infect mobile phones running Symbian OS.  It is believed to be the first computer worm that can infect mobile phones.  When a phone is infected with Cabir, the message \"Caribe\" is displayed on the phone's display, and is displayed every time the phone is turned on.  The worm then attempts to spread to other phones in the area using wireless Bluetooth signals.\n\nAn online service provider can, for example, be an Internet service provider, an email provider, a news provider (press), an entertainment provider (music, movies), a search engine, an e-commerce site, an online banking site, a health site, an official government site, a wiki, or a Usenet newsgroup.  In its original more limited definition, it referred only to a commercial computer communication service in which paid members could dial via a computer modem the service's private computer network and access various services and information resources such a bulletin boards, downloadable files and programs, news articles, chat rooms, and electronic mail services.  The term \"online service\" was also used in references to these dial-up services.  The traditional dial-up online service differed from the modern Internet service provider in that they provided a large degree of content that was only accessible by those who subscribed to the online service, while ISP mostly serves to provide access to the Internet and generally provides little if any exclusive content of its own.  In the U.S., the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) portion of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has expanded the legal definition of online service in two different ways for different portions of the law.  It states in section 512(k)(1):\n\nA payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card or direct payments processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar.  The payment gateway may be provided by a bank to its customers, but can be provided by a specialised financial service provider as a separate service, such as a payment service provider.\n\nA business service provider (BSP) is one of several categories of service provider in the business world.  As opposed to an application service provider which provides application components over a computer network, the services provided by a BSP are more in the area of infrastructure: mail delivery, building security, finance, administration, and human resources.  Unlike an ASP, a BSP provides business processes as services, providing partial or full business process outsourcing.  They are often subdivided into two types: \"back office\" and \"front office\" BSPs.\n\nMimail is a computer worm which first emerged in August 2003; it is transmitted via e-mail.

It was later featured in the 1978 film version, sung by cast members Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (credited as The Wiz Stars).  Given the all-Black cast of \"The Wiz\", the song's many references to freedom and new possibilities (especially as sung by African American characters who had just been freed from enslavement) certainly invoked the struggles and history of Blacks in America.  In the onscreen version of the song, Nipsey Russell can even be heard exclaiming \"Free at last!\" \u2014a reference to civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. (His impromptu addition to the song is not heard on the soundtrack album version, instead replaced by sung vocals by Diana Ross.)\n\n\"La Carretera\" (English: \"The Road\") is a 2016 song by American singer Prince Royce.

Nanawa (Enxet for \"carob tree forest\"), established by the Paraguayans in 1928, was considered the strongest Paraguayan outpost after it was heavily fortified by the end of 1932 under directives of Ivan Belaieff and Nicolas Ern, two White Russian veterans who joined the Paraguayan army in the 1920s.  Zig-zag trenches, barbed wire and machine gun nests were built by the garrison around a horseshoe-shaped defence.  Nanawa's commander, Col. Luis Irraz\u00e1bal, summoned under his command four regiments and several minor units which made up the Paraguayan fifth division.  The commander-in-chief of the Bolivian army, German World War I veteran Hans Kundt, commanded the Bolivian assault personally in place.  The Bolivian army launched three attacks that stalled after seizing some parts of the stronghold.  After this failure, the Bolivian troops attempted to dig a trench around the Nanawa complex to isolate it but were met by Paraguayan reinforcements.  Heavy rains forced the Bolivians to abandon what they had captured of the complex and the Paraguayans soon recovered these positions.\n\nMario Ter\u00e1n (born c. 1940) is the Bolivian Army sergeant who was chosen to carry out the execution of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara as a young man on October 9, 1967.\n\nErnesto \"Che\" Guevara (] June 14, 1928 \u2013 October 9, 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat and military theorist.

Although during his lifetime he was a highly politicized and controversial figure, in death his stylized image has been transformed into a worldwide emblem for an array of causes, representing a complex mesh of sometimes conflicting narratives.  Che Guevara's image is viewed as everything from an inspirational icon of revolution, to a retro and vintage logo.  Most commonly he is represented by a facial caricature originally by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick and based on Alberto Korda's famous 1960 photograph titled \"Guerrillero Heroico\".  The evocative simulacra abbreviation of the photographic portrait allowed for easy reproduction and instant recognizability across various uses.  For many around the world, Che has become a generic symbol of the underdog, the idealist, the iconoclast, or the martyr.  He has become, as author Michael Casey notes in \"Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image\", \"the quintessential postmodern icon signifying anything to anyone and everything to everyone.\"\n\nChe is a two-part 2008 biopic about Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Benicio del Toro.  Rather than follow a standard chronological order, the films offer an oblique series of interspersed moments along the overall timeline.  \"Part One\" is entitled \"The Argentine\" and focuses on the Cuban Revolution from the landing of Fidel Castro, Guevara, and other revolutionaries in Cuba to their successful toppling of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship two years later.  \"Part Two\" is entitled \"Guerrilla\" and focuses on Guevara's attempt to bring revolution to Bolivia and his demise.  Both parts are shot in a cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, but each has different approaches to linear narrative, camerawork and the visual look.\n\nHayd\u00e9e Tamara Bunke Bider (November 19, 1937 \u2013 August 31, 1967), better known as Tania or Tania the Guerrilla, was an Argentine-born East German communist revolutionary and spy who played a prominent role in the Cuban government after the Cuban Revolution and in various Latin American revolutionary movements.  She was the only woman to fight alongside Marxist guerrillas under Che Guevara during the Bolivian Insurgency (1966\u20131967) where she was killed in an ambush by CIA-assisted Bolivian Army Rangers.\n\nThe legacy of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (June 14, 1928 \u2013 October 9, 1967) is constantly evolving in the collective imagination.  As a ubiquitous symbol of counterculture worldwide, Guevara is one of the most recognizable and influential revolutionary figures of the twentieth century.  However, during his life, and even more since his death, Che has elicited controversy and wildly divergent opinions as to who he was and what he represented.  Mostly revered and occasionally reviled, he is passionately characterized along the entire continuum as everything from a heroic defender of the poor, to a cold-hearted executioner.  Admired, sanctified, romanticized and derided, his crystallized status as either a brilliant intellectual or a violent ideologue is usually dependent on where one falls along the left and right of the political spectrum.  The debate around his legacy is further complicated by the fact that Guevara exists simultaneously as several different entities, both literal man and global emblem, leading to disputes between what people contend he did and what he now represents.\n\nThe Battle of Ca\u00f1ada Strongest was a battle fought from May 10\u201325, 1934, between the Bolivian and Paraguayan armies during the Chaco War.  The engagement is considered the greatest victory of the Bolivian army during the war, and actually took place some 60\u00a0km southwest of Ca\u00f1ada Strongest, near a dried riverbed called Ca\u00f1ada Esperanza.  The battle was a Paraguayan attempt to outflank and eventually conquer Fort Ballivian, a large stronghold that was the keystone of Bolivian defenses along the border with Argentina.  Paraguayans begun to open a new trail in the dry subtropical forests of the Chaco but were discovered by Bolivian aerial reconnaissance.  The Paraguayans troops, unaware of having been discovered, were encircled by Bolivian forces who had sneaked up on the path and were waiting for a substantial number of Paraguayan troops to enter the pathway before they ambushed them.  A 250-man Paraguayan detachment sent in to monitor the Bolivian movements was also surrounded and eventually captured on May 25 along L\u00f3brego Path, a route between the first Paraguayan lines and Ca\u00f1ada Esperanza.  The Bolivian army took 1,500 prisoners and a good amount of weaponry, trucks and supplies, while almost 400 Paraguayan soldiers were killed.  A whole Paraguayan division, however, managed to slip away, along with some scattered units.\n\n", "correct": true}

Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to \"When Radio Was\").  \"The Mountain 94.9\" carries local high school sports in season.  \"The Mountain 94.9\" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on \"The Mountain 94.9\" during Baseball season).  The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades).  Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located.  The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc.  WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9.  Prior to their \"The Mountain 94.9\" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as \"North Country 95\", airing a full-time Country Music format.  The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent.  Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location).  On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC.  WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates\u2014apart from WLOB\u2014of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show.  WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18\u00bc hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET).  In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk.  In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air).\n\n", "correct": false}

The last of Saint-Sa\u00ebns' operas, it premiered on 14 March 1911 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte-Carlo.  One of the opera's central characters, Hercule (Hercules), had been the subject of two earlier symphonic poems by Saint-Sa\u00ebns \u2013 \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" (1872) and \"La Jeunesse d'Hercule\" (1877).  The story is based on \"The Trachiniae\" by Sophocles (also the source for Handel's opera \"Hercules\").\n\nBelow is a list of compositions by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.  The works are categorized by genre, opus number, Ratner catalogue number, date of composition and titles.

While an organist at Madeleine, Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the oratorio in less than a fortnight, completing it ten days before its premiere on Christmas 1858.  The vocal score of this oratorio was prepared later by the composer and organist Eugene Gigout, a colleague of Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\n\nThe Piano Concerto No. 3 in E flat major, Op.  29 by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, was composed in 1869.  The concerto is written in 3 movements.  When the concerto was first performed by Saint-Sa\u00ebns himself at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1869 it was not well received, possibly because of its harmonic experimentation.  Saint-Sa\u00ebns's third concerto is not as often performed as his famous second concerto, or the fourth or fifth concertos, but it is still an important addition to the piano concerto repertoire.  It was dedicated to \u00c9lie-Miriam Delaborde, a pianist who is believed to have been the natural son of Charles-Valentin Alkan.\n\nFranz Ferenczy (also Franz Friedemann) (1835 \u2013 27 February 1881, Weimar) was a nineteenth-century German tenor who had a prolific opera career in Europe between 1859-1880.

The opera premiered at the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo in Monaco on 18 February 1904.

Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the concerto in three weeks, and had very little time to prepare for the premi\u00e8re; consequently, the piece was not initially successful.

He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942.  Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument.  The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety.  For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue.  Dr. Firestone\u2019s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally.  Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957.  Among Firestone\u2019s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an \u201cautomatic device for the minute inspection of flaws\u201d, \u201ca new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus\u201d, and \u201c[a] device for measuring noise\u201d, and, even, later a \u201cmusical typewriter\u201d.\n\nGeophysical Journal International is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Deutsche Geophysikalische Gesellschaft (German Geophysical Society).

Its objective is to protect the rights of children in Nepal.  It was established in 1987, when an informal group of students at Tribhuvan University, taking a lead from Child Workers in Asia (CWA), investigated the conditions of street children in Kathmandu.  As a watchdog in the field of child rights in Nepal, CWIN acts as a voice for disadvantaged and exploited children, through lobbying, campaigning and pressuring the government to protect and promote children's rights, and to end exploitation, abuse and discrimination against children.\n\nMulti-male groups, also known as multi-male/multi-female, are a type of social organization where the group contains more than one adult male, more than one adult female, and offspring.  Within Order Primates, it is the most common social group type, with group sizes ranging from 10 to 100 individuals.  Large groups of primates are called \"troops.\"  Examples of species that can be categorized under this type of social organization include many diurnal lemurs, langurs, and most members of the family Cebidae.\n\nThe Republic of the Congo (ROC) is a destination and transit country for children subjected to trafficking in persons for the purposes of forced labor and forced prostitution.  Most sources agree that up to 80 percent of all trafficked children originate from Benin, with girls comprising 90 percent of that group.  Togo, Mali, Guinea, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Senegal are also sources of victims found in the Congolese republic.  Internally trafficked children represent 10 percent of all child victims, the majority of which originate from the Pool region.  Many child victims are subjected to forced labor, including in domestic work, market vending and fishing; girls are also exploited in the sex trade.  Child victims generally experience harsh treatment, long work hours, and almost no access to education or health services; they receive little or no remuneration for their work.  Other village children, however, live voluntarily with extended relatives in cities, attend school, and do housework in exchange for food, in a traditional cultural and familial pattern that does not entail abuse.\n\nBarbados is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor.  Some children in Barbados are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation in \u201ctransactional sex\u201d wherein a third party such as a parent receives a benefit from the child\u2019s participation in sexual activity.  Researchers identified patterns of transactional sex within families, most often by adult male caretakers such as step-fathers, as well as child prostitution outside the home.  Women from the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Jamaica voluntarily enter Barbados as illegal migrants, and some expect to engage in prostitution.  Some of these women are exploited in forced prostitution subsequent to their arrival.  Some other foreign women who entered the country illegally are exploited in involuntary domestic servitude in private homes.  Foreign men have been transported to Barbados for the purpose of labor exploitation in construction and other sectors.  Sex traffickers, primarily organized criminals from Guyana, form partnerships with pimps and brothel owners from Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, and lure women to Barbados with offers of legitimate work.  Trafficking victims tend to enter the country through legal means, usually by air; traffickers later use force and coercion to obtain and maintain the victims\u2019 work in strip clubs, massage parlors, some private residences, and \u201centertainment clubs\u201d which operate as brothels.  Traffickers use methods such as threats of physical harm or deportation, debt bondage, false contracts, psychological abuse, and confinement to force victims to work in construction, the garment industry, agriculture, or private households.\n\nCameroon is a country of origin, transit, and destination for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor, and a country of origin for women in forced labor.  Individual trafficking operations usually involve the trafficking of two or three children at most, as when rural parents hand over their children to a seemingly benevolent middleman who may promise education and a better life in the city.  A 2007 study conducted by the Cameroon government reported that 2.4 million children from the country\u2019s ten regions involuntarily work in forced domestic servitude, street vending, and child prostitution, or in hazardous settings, including mines and tea or cocoa plantations, where they are treated as adult laborers; an unknown number of these children are trafficking victims.  Nigerian and Beninese children attempting to transit Cameroon en route to Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, or adjacent countries also fall into the hands of traffickers who force them to stay in the country and work.  An unknown number of Cameroonian women are lured abroad by fraudulent proposals of marriage on the Internet or offers of work in domestic service and subsequently become victims of forced labor or forced prostitution \u2013 principally in Switzerland and France, and according to recent reports, as far away as Russia.  This trafficking reportedly is facilitated by corrupt officials who accept bribes for the issuance of travel documents.\n\nMihail Mikhailovich Chemiakin (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u0301\u043b \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0435\u043c\u044f\u0301\u043a\u0438\u043d , Mikhail Shemyakin, or Mikhail Shemiakin, born 4 May 1943, Moscow) is a Russian painter, stage designer, sculptor and publisher, and a controversial representative of the nonconformist art tradition of St. Petersburg.\n\nSchool teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.  When an adult bullies a child, it is referred to as psychological, emotional, or verbal abuse.  According to the American Psychological Association, it is as harmful to children as sexual or physical abuse.  \"Children who are emotionally abused and neglected face similar and sometimes worse mental health problems as children who are physically or sexually abused, yet psychological abuse is rarely addressed in prevention programs or in treating victims, according to a new study published by the American Psychological Association.\"\n\nA victims' rights group is a type of advocacy group which advocates or lobbies for legal, social or political change on behalf of victims of serious crime or injustice.  Members of such groups often include family members or friends of such victims.\n\nChildren Are the Victims of Adult Vices is a group of bronze sculptures created by Russian artist Mihail Chemiakin.  The sculptures are located in a park in Bolotnaya Square, Balchug, 2000 ft south of the Moscow Kremlin behind the British Ambassador's residence.\n\nFiji is a source country for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution within the country, as well as a destination country for women from China in forced prostitution.  Family members, other Fijian citizens, foreign tourists, and sailors on foreign fishing vessels participate in the commercial sexual exploitation of Fijian children.  Staff at smaller, local hotels procure underage girls and boys for commercial sexual exploitation by foreign guests, while taxi drivers, nightclub employees, and relatives frequently act as prostitution facilitators.  NGOs report caring for child victims of prostitution who claim facilitators took them to private boats anchored offshore near Fiji where they were sexually abused or raped by foreign adult men.  Reports indicate that some transnational traffickers are members of Chinese organized crime groups that recruit women from China and arrange for them to enter Fiji on tourist or student visas.  After their arrival, brothel owners confiscate their passports and force the women to engage in prostitution.  Some Fijian children whose families follow a traditional practice of sending children to live with and do light work for relatives or families living in cities or near schools become trafficking victims.  These children are subjected to involuntary domestic servitude or are coerced to engage in sexual activity in exchange for food, clothing, shelter, or school fees.\n\n", "correct": true}

{"id": 77, "question": "Is Gongzhuling or Hong Kong the world's fourth most densely populated country or territory?", "answer": "hong kong", "pred": "hong kong", "original_context": "New Territories () is one of the three main regions of Hong Kong, alongside Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula.  It makes up 86.2% of Hong Kong's territory, and contains around half of the population of Hong Kong.  Historically, it is the region described in The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory.  According to that the territories comprise the mainland area north of the Boundary Street of Kowloon Peninsula and south of the Sham Chun River which is the border between Hong Kong and Mainland China, as well as over 200 outlying Islands including Lantau Island, Lamma Island, Cheung Chau, and Peng Chau in the territory of Hong Kong.\n\nThe right of abode in Hong Kong is the right to legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or condition of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department.  As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their right of abode in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover.  Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status.  Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the \"de-facto\" citizenship status in Hong Kong.  Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.\n\nYouth in Hong Kong, according to the University of Hong Kong Statistical Profile, includes citizens of the Chinese territory of Hong Kong aged 15\u201324 years.

It is also the point for which Virgin Trains East Coast services from London divide, either branching off to Leeds or continuing north to Scotland via Newcastle and the North East.\n\nCollegiate secret societies within America's universities have a long tradition, initially started within East Coast colleges, and eventually trickling down into what became the secret societies found at America's oldest boarding schools.  Between 1898 and 1908, high school secret societies were a recognizable feature within the school system, and Otto C. Schneider, President of the Chicago School Board of 1908, took an active role in stopping their influence within secondary schools.  Initial growth in the Midwest may have been fueled by competition with the East Coast.  Boston Latin, the oldest public school in America, and Erasmus High School often had football matches with Chicago's top public schools, thereby spreading an influence from the East Coast to the Midwest.\n\nThe Seaboard-All Florida Railway was a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad that oversaw two major extensions of the system in the early 1920s to southern Florida on each coast during the land boom.  One line extended the Seaboard's tracks on the east coast from West Palm Beach down to Miami (and later, Homestead), while the other extension on the west coast extended the tracks from Fort Ogden south to Fort Myers and Naples, with branches from Fort Myers to LaBelle and Punta Rassa.  These two extensions were heavily championed by Seaboard president S. Davies Warfield (who died months after its completion), and were constructed by Foley Brothers railroad contractors.  Both extensions also allowed the Seaboard to better compete with the Florida East Coast Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, who already served the lower east and west coasts of Florida respectively.  Today, only the east coast route survives, though a few related structures from the abandoned west coast line still stand.\n\nEast Coast Park Service Road (Chinese: \u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\u516c\u56ed\u526f\u8def; Malay: \"Jalan Perkhidmatan Taman Pantai Timur\" ) is a road in Singapore that runs along the northern perimeter of the East Coast Park and parallel to the East Coast Parkway.

Gemas is the rail junction between the West Coast line and East Coast railway line.  Like the West Coast Railway Line, it is called the East Coast Railway Line (Malaysia) because it serves two of Peninsular Malaysia's East Coast states, namely Pahang and Kelantan.  In fact, it does not run along the coast at all and only meets the South China Sea when it terminates in Tumpat railway station.  It runs through the interior, often through deep jungle, thus earning the nickname Jungle Railway.  Terengganu is the only state in Peninsular Malaysia not served by the KTM railway network.\n\nMetagonimoides oregonensis is a trematode, or fluke worm, in the family Heterophyidae.  This North American parasite is found primarily in the intestines of raccoons (\"Procyon lotor\"), American minks (\"Neovision vision\"), frogs in the genus \"Rana\", and freshwater snails in the genus \"Goniobasis\".  It was first described in 1931 by E. W. Price.  The parasite has a large distribution, from Oregon to North Carolina.  Adult flukes vary in host range and morphology dependent on the geographical location.  This results in different life cycles, as well as intermediate hosts, across the United States.  On the west coast, the intermediate host is freshwater snails (\"Goniobasis\"), while on the east coast the intermediate host is salamanders (\"Desmognathus\").  The parasites on the west coast are generally much larger than on the east coast.  For example, the pharynx as well as the body of the parasite are distinctly larger in Oregon than in North Carolina.  The reverse pattern is observed on the east coast for uterine eggs, which are larger on the west coast.  In snails, there is also a higher rate of infection in female snails than in males.  Research on the life history traits of the parasites have been performed with hamsters and frogs as model species.\n\nVirgin Trains East Coast is a train operating company in the United Kingdom that operates the InterCity East Coast franchise on the East Coast Main Line between London, Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland.

Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) , is a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held, in a 5\u20134 decision, that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home, and that Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban and requirement that lawfully-owned rifles and shotguns be kept \"unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock\" violated this guarantee.  Due to Washington, D.C. 's special status as a federal district, the decision did not address the question of whether the Second Amendment's protections are incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against the states, which was addressed two years later by \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\" (2010) in which it was found that they are.  It was the first Supreme Court case to decide whether the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n\nStephen P.

He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (\"Heller\", \"McDonald\", \"Printz v. United States\").  He has testified before congress on multiple occasions.  Halbrook\u2019s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book \"That Every Man Be Armed\", originally published in 1986.  The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment.\n\nDavid Edward Finley, Jr. (September 1, 1890 \u2013 February 1, 1977) was an American cultural leader during the middle third of the 20th century.

{"id": 94, "question": "What language were books being translated into during the era of Haymo of Faversham?", "answer": "latin", "pred": "latin", "original_context": "The first portion of the Bible, the Gospel of John, in Tibetan language was translated by Moravian Church missionaries William Heyde, Edward Pagel, and Heinrich August J\u00e4schke, and later Dr. August Francke.  It was printed in 1862 at Kyelang capital of Lahul in Kashmir.  The whole New Testament was printed in 1885 in Ladakh.  Another version was translated in 1903.  So as not to have the problem of various dialectal differences it was translated into classical Tibetan, but this was not understood by most people.  Yoseb Gergen (aka Sonam Gergen), a Tibetan Christian translated the entire Bible, complete in 1935.  This version was translated into a dialect of Tibetan Gergen had accidentally stumbled across, and which was understandable by all Tibetans.  It was finally published in 1948.  This is known in India as the Tibetan OV Bible.  Eliya Tsetan Phuntshog published a New Testament in 1970.  There is currently a project going on to translate the Bible into the East Tibetan dialect.\n\nThe \"Recovery of Aristotle\" (or Rediscovery) refers to the copying or re-translating of most of Aristotle's books (of ancient Greece), from Greek or Arabic text into Latin, during the Middle Ages, of the Latin West.  The Recovery of Aristotle spanned about 100 years, from the middle 12th century into the 13th century, and copied or translated over 42 books (see: Corpus Aristotelicum), including Arabic texts from Arabic authors, where the previous Latin versions had only two books in general circulation: \"Categories\" and \"On Interpretation\" (\"De Interpretatione\").\n\nPreservation of the Sign Language is a two-minute film, presented without subtitles, featuring George Veditz, onetime president of the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) of the United States, demonstrating in sign language the importance of defending the right of deaf people to sign as opposed to verbalizing their communication.  Deafened by scarlet fever at the age of eight, Veditz was one of the first to make motion-picture recordings of American Sign Language.  Taking care to sign precisely and in large gestures for the cameras, Veditz chose fiery biblical passages to give his speech emotional impact.  In some of his films, Veditz used finger spelling so his gestures could be translated directly into English in venues where interpreters were present.  On behalf of the NAD, Veditz made this film specifically to record sign language for posterity at a time when oralists (those who promoted lip reading and speech in lieu of sign language) were gaining momentum in the education of the deaf.  The film conveys one of the ways that deaf Americans debated the issues of their language and public understanding during the era of World War I.\n\nAmri, or Dumura Karbi, is spoken by the Karbi people of Assam and Meghalaya.  The Dumura Karbi language is also called Arleng Alam or \"Ili Lam\" meaning 'Our language' by the speakers.  And the Assamese Language speaking people call it Mikir Bhakha.  Latin script is used for institutional practice, but authors use both Latin and Assamese script in various publications.  The speakers consider their speech as a variety of the Karbi language. N.B. Amri word is accepted by few Karbi Peoples only.  But majority of people of Karbi does not accept this Amri nomenclature for the said language.  Because the Amri Kingdom is situated inside the Karbi Anglong district of Assam.  But said language is spoken by peoples of Dumura Recho kingdom which is situated outside Karbi Anglong district.  So majority of people don't accept Amri nomenclature.  The first published book of this language is Arleng Karbi Rat Abhakha Akitap written by Monuram Karkun(Kam Phangcho), in 1955.  In 1984 Pinkit Alun is published by AKBKA (Amri Karbi Baptist Kachikruk Ason.  It is a collection of gospel songs of christian religion (Baptist).  After this lots of literary works are practiced in Magazines.  A few poetry and song books are also found.  In 2003 Bhayam Karbi Byakaran written by Biren Keleng is published.

The language had a news paper Adap Arni published by Karbi Lamme Amei, Kamrup District Committee.  Now it is out of publication.  Ranjendra Tumung and Manik Teron write and publish a dictionary on this language.  After 1977 the Amri words is used mistakenly by few political leaders.  Since then there is silent community war is observed within the people of this language speakers.  Only by few christian religious books authors and their followers use the Amri words in their books.  Which becomes an obstacle to develop this language.  At present it has a quarterly magazine named as Worjul aSi.  In this magazine it is seen to prefer Arleng Alam for this language instead of Amri and Dumurali.\n\nHaymo of Faversham, O.F.M. ( c.\u20091243 ), was an English Franciscan scholar.  His scholastic epithet was Inter Aristotelicos Aristotelicissimus (Latin for \"Most Aristotelian among the Aristotelians\"), referring to his stature among the Scholastics during the Recovery of Aristotle amid the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance.

Its status now has been changed to attached department.  Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between national and provincial governments and institutions for using Urdu language.  However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include standardisation and linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography.  It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life.  In this respect, large amounts of legal and scientific documents are translated from English and other languages for publication into Urdu.  These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation.  Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department.  The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage & Integration.Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist Dr. Anwaar Ahmad was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).\n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series of fantasy novels by J. K. Rowling have become some of the most widely read works of children's literature in history, with readers of all ages and in many countries.  In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies.  Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into.  As best as can be determined (as of 2017), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 73 other languages.  A 74th language, Scots, was announced on 2017-06-28 and it is expected to be available in October, 2017.  Both Bloomsbury's and J.K. Rowling's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (80 with the 2017-06-28 announcement of Scots); however, it has been argued that number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English.  The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language.  Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages).  English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be (indeed, it is why our list here counts up to 74).  Thus: 79 \u2212 English \u2212 5 double-translations = 73.  It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books are have been translated into these 73 languages.\n\nIn translation, the source language is the language being translated from; it is the antonym of the target language, which is the language being translated to.  Part of the difficulty in translation arises due to the lexical gap between the source language and the target language.  The necessity of translation arises from that gap, especially between two languages belonging to different language families.\n\nFortune Told in Blood (Fal-E Khoon) (Persian: \u200e \u200e ) is a novel about an Iraqi lieutenant and soldier in Iran-Iraq war by Davud Ghaffarzadegan.

In \"We Broke the Rules\", Aventura pioneered the incorporation of elements of urban music like Pop, Hip-hop, and R&B, giving Bachata a new flavor and extending its appeal to those who preferred urban music styles.  This new recipe used in \"We Broke the Rules\" gave birth to a new style of Bachata, \u201cThe NewYork School\u201d or \u201cUrban Bachata,\u201d which is characterized by the inclusion of electric guitars instead of acoustic, and lyrics in Spanish and English instead of just Spanish.  In addition, the singing style takes after R&B melodies.  Part of this album\u2019s success was because Aventura\u2019s new style sounded smoother and more modern than previous Bachata groups\u2019.  \"We Broke the Rules\" was the beginning of Aventura\u2019s success and the final step in solidifying Bachata as a relevant music genre, internationally speaking.  The biggest hit of the album was a song called \"Obsesi\u00f3n\" featuring Judy Santos.  According to the article called, \"Aventura\u2019s Adventure\", \u201cObsesion, was the very first bachata act to land a No. 1 single, in Spanish, in virtually every European territory.\u201d  The song did more than just attract a Dominican or Spanish-speaking audience.  Proof of its success is that the album sold around 1.5 million units internationally and remained in the number one position in the European charts in countries like Italy, France, Germany, and Norway for several weeks.  For example, Obsession remained in the number one position in the French top 100 singles charts for seven weeks.

Browne's then-girlfriend Daryl Hannah provides background vocals and appears in the song's music video painting and later filming the duo.  Also appearing in the video is a backing band, including songwriter Walden on drums.  The 'B-Side' was a song called \"Let the Music Say It\" not included on the album \"Hero\".  \"Let the Music Say It\" was produced in 1985 and written by Clemons and Michael Jonzun.\n\nGroup Home is a hip hop duo, composed of members Lil' Dap (birth name James Heath) and Melachi the Nutcracker (birth name Jamal Felder).  They came to prominence as members of the Gang Starr Foundation.  Lil' Dap made his rhyming debut on Gang Starr's 1992 classic \"Daily Operation\" on the song \"I'm the Man\".  Both members appeared on Gang Starr's critically acclaimed 1994 effort \"Hard to Earn\", on the tracks \"Speak Ya Clout\" and \"Words from the Nutcracker\".  In 1995, the group released its debut album, \"Livin' Proof\".  The album was very well received, mainly due to DJ Premier's advanced production work, described by \"Allmusic\" as \"rhythmic masterpieces\".  A second album \"A Tear for the Ghetto\" was released in 1999, this time with only one track produced by DJ Premier.\n\nGerrie is Dutch and Afrikaans unisex given name.  It is a diminutive of Ger, itself short for Gerard.  As a birth name in the Netherlands, it is primarily feminine, peaking in popularities around 1950, but the name is more common as a nickname for men with the birth name Gerard(us) or Gerrit.\n\n", "correct": false}

Following the acquisition of TSR by Wizards of the Coast, the game was discontinued in 2000 as part of a broader rationalisation of TSR's business holdings, but it retains a small and devoted fanbase.  Parts of \"Alternity\" as well as TSR's classic \"Star Frontiers\" game have been incorporated into the \"d20 Modern\" game, especially the \"d20 Future\" setting.  The first campaign setting for the \"Alternity\" game, the \"Star*Drive\" setting, was introduced in 1998.\n\nTwilight Calling is an adventure module for the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" fantasy role-playing game, set in that game's Mystara campaign setting.  TSR, Inc. published the module in 1986 for the \"D&D Master Set\" rules.  It is part of the \"M\" series of modules.

The game offered a space opera action-adventure setting.\n\nRevolt On Antares is a science fiction themed microgame designed by Tom Moldvay and produced by TSR, Inc. in 1981.  Similar to the microgames produced by Steve Jackson Games, it was sold in a transparent plastic shell case and came with rulebook, full-color hex-map, counters, and one six-sided die.  Other games in this series (called \"minigames\" by TSR) include \"They've Invaded Pleasantville! \", \"Remember the Alamo\", \"Attack Force\", \"Vampyre\", \"Viking Gods\", \"Icebergs\" and \"Saga\".\n\nTom Moldvay (Thomas Steven Moldvay, Nov. 5, 1948 \u2013 March 9, 2007) was a game designer and author most notable for his work on early materials for the fantasy role-playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (D&D).\n\nMetamorphosis Alpha is a science fiction role-playing game.

It was the first science fiction role-playing game, published in July 1976.\n\nThe Lost City (B4) is a \"Dungeons & Dragons\" adventure module by Tom Moldvay.  It was first published by TSR in 1982 and was designed as a stand-alone adventure for use with the \"Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set\".  The working title for the module was \"The Lost City of Cynidecia\".  Moldvay designed the module to give novice Dungeon Masters experience fleshing out adventures and is only partially complete.  The module is described as a low-level scenario, in which the only hope of the player characters' survival can be found in a ruined city slowly rising out of the sands.  The adventure is set inside a huge step pyramid, with the lower pyramid only sketched out and the city itself described with a list of the major areas and a map.  The adventure\u2019s main villain is Zargon, a giant one-eyed monster and his minions.

In fact it was originally titled \"Traveller: 2300\", but this caused confusion as the game used neither the rules system nor the setting of the original \"Traveller\".  The game was therefore renamed in its 2nd edition.\n\n", "correct": true}
{"id": 98, "question": "Are both Brassocattleya and Buckinghamia orchids?", "answer": "no", "pred": "no, buckinghamia is not an orchid; it is a genus of trees in the proteaceae family. brassocattleya is an intergeneric orchid hybrid", "original_context": "Calochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.  Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia.\n\nThelymitra, commonly known as sun orchids, is a genus of more than 100 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Unlike most other orchids, sun orchids lack a highly modified labellum and all three petals are similar in size, shape and colour.  The column is, however highly modified and usually has prominent wings or glands which are helpful in identifying the species.  Most sun orchids close their flowers at night, in cloudy or cool weather, giving rise to their common name.  The scientific name means \"woman's hood\" and refers to the hooded column present in most, but not all species.  Most species are endemic to Australia although some are found as far from there as the Philippines and Indonesia.  The type species, \"Thelymitra longifolia\", the first to be formally described, was collected in New Zealand.\n\nCaladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state.\n\nBuckinghamia is a genus of only two known species of trees, belonging to the plant family Proteaceae.  They grow naturally only (endemic) in the rainforests of the wet tropics region of north eastern Queensland, Australia.  The ivory curl flower, \"B. celsissima\", is the well known, popular and widely cultivated species in gardens and parks, in eastern and southern mainland Australia, and additionally as street trees north from about Brisbane.  The second species, \"B. ferruginiflora\", was only recently described in 1988.\n\nLady's slipper orchids (also known as lady slipper orchids or slipper orchids) are orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae, which comprises the genera \"Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium\" and \"Selenipedium\".  They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labellums) of the flowers \u2013 the pouch traps insects so they are forced to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower.\n\nMicrotis, commonly known as onion orchids or mignonette orchids is a genus of about 20 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Onion orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant.  They are similar to orchids in the genus \"Prasophyllum\" in that they have an onion-like leaf.  The flowers are small but often scented and attractive to their insect pollinators.  They are widespread in Asia, Australia and some Pacific islands.\n\nBrassocattleya or Brasso-cattleya, abbreviated Bc.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric orchid hybrid derived from the genera \"Brassavola\" and \"Cattleya\".\n\nCypripedium is a genus of 58 species and nothospecies of hardy orchids; it is one of five genera that together compose the subfamily of lady's slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae).  They are widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere, including most of Europe (one species), Russia, China, Central Asia, Canada the United States, Mexico, and Central America.  They are most commonly known as slipper orchids or lady's slipper orchids; other common names include moccasin flower, camel's foot, squirrel foot, steeple cap, Venus' shoes, and whippoorwill shoe.  An abbreviation used in trade journals is \"Cyp.\"  The word \"\"Cypripedium\"\" is derived from the Late Latin: \"Cypris\", from Ancient\u00a0Greek: \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \u00a0\"(Kypris)\" , an early reference in Greek myth to Aphrodite, and Greek: \"pedilon\", meaning \"sandal\".\n\nWilliam Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 \u2013 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to \"The Victorian Naturalist\", many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, \"Orchids of Australia\" in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include \"Caladenia caudata\", \"Caladenia echidnachila\", \"Caladenia ensata\", \"Caladenia ferruginea\", \"Caladenia magniclavata\", \"Caladenia ornata\", \"Caladenia praecox\", \"Caladenia radiata\", \"Pterostylis fischii\", \"Pterostylis hamiltonii\", \"Pterostylis hildii\" and \"Pterostylis tenuissima\".\n\nParacaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.  The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to \"Caleana major\", but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  \"Paraceleana\" orchids, as well as hammer orchids (\"Drakaea\") are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers.\n\n", "correct": false}

It is variously dated to the early 1430s, implying an original van Eyck, or c. 1440, making it a pastiche by a workshop member after Jan's death.  The only other known van Eyck drawing is the \"Study for Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Albergati\" if you exclude the 1437 \"Saint Barbara\" as an unfinished painting, although there are similarities between the two; especially in it's perspective, the angel of the viewer's point of view, and the shadings of the rock formations.  The quality of draftsmanship is of the first rate, and it is perhaps the most elaborate and complex surviving drawing from the 16th century.\n\nMedieval theatre refers to theatrical performance in the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D. and the beginning of the Renaissance in approximately the 15th century A.D. Medieval Theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including liturgical drama, mystery plays, morality plays, farces and masques. Beginning with Hrosvitha of Gandersheim in the 10th century, Medieval drama was for the most part very religious and moral in its themes, staging and traditions.  The most famous examples of Medieval plays are the English cycle dramas, the York Mystery Plays, the Chester Mystery Plays, the Wakefield Mystery Plays and the N-Town Plays, as well as the morality play, \"Everyman\".  One of the earliest surviving secular plays in English is \"The Interlude of the Student and the Girl\" (c. 1300).\n\nThe Chester Mystery Plays is a cycle of mystery plays dating back to at least the early part of the 15th century.\n\nThe MacMhuirich bardic family, known in Scottish Gaelic as Clann MacMhuirich and Clann Mhuirich, was a prominent family of bards and other professionals in 15th to 18th centuries.  The family was centred in the Hebrides, and claimed descent from a 13th-century Irish bard who, according to legend, was exiled to Scotland.  The family was at first chiefly employed by the Lords of the Isles as poets, lawyers, and physicians.  With the fall of the Lordship of the Isles in the 15th century, the family was chiefly employed by the chiefs of the MacDonalds of Clanranald.  Members of the family were also recorded as musicians in the early 16th century, and as clergymen possibly as early as the early 15th century.\n\nA trumpet is a blown musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles.  The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family.  Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500\u00a0BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.  Trumpets, which are blow horns are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music.  They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.  Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.\n\nPogorzela is first mentioned in the early 15th century when the town was owned by Wczel\u00f3w-Pogorzelskich.  It is notable as the birthplace of Preczlaw of Pogarell a medieval Roman Catholic Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw.  In the 16th century the town became a center of Lutheranism, and in the 18th century became a centre of light industries.\n\nBlackwater Castle (Castle Widenham) is a privately owned estate located in the village of Castletownroche between the towns of Mallow and Fermoy in North Cork, Ireland, and since 2005 is available to rent as a private hire venue for castle weddings and private parties along with castle rentals for vacations.  The castle comprises one of the oldest occupied castles in Ireland as parts of the residential section date back to the early 15th century while the castle structure itself dates back to the 12th century.  A round tower on the eastern end of the Castle dating from the late 12th century is still standing although no longer accessible.  The castle was constructed on the ancient fortress of Dun Cruadha, an inland promontory fort dating back to the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age, while the site itself was first occupied back in the Mesolithic age (circa 9,000 years ago) as evidenced by the flint scatter found at Kilcummer and the caves on the south bank of the River Awbeg making this site one of the earliest known settlements in Ireland.\n\nJaume Roig (early 15th century, Val\u00e8ncia - April 1478, Benim\u00e0met) was a doctor in the city of Val\u00e8ncia and the author of \"Espill\" (Mirror), a work of medieval literature in the Catalan language.  Together with Ausi\u00e0s March, and Isabel de Villena, Jaume Roig is one of the three writers chosen by Henry W. Longfellow to summarise the literature of the 15th century in the Catalan language.\n\nElisaeus Adougan was a late 14th century and early 15th century Scottish cleric.  His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390, but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years.\n\nThe history of watches began in 16th century Europe, where watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first appeared in the 15th century.  Portable timepieces were made possible by the invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century.  Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1485-1542) is often credited as the inventor of the watch.  He was one of the first German craftsman who made \"clock-watches\" (\"taschenuhr\"), ornamental timepieces worn as pendants, which were the first timepieces to be worn on the body.  His fame is based on a passage by Johann Cochl\u00e4us in 1511:\n\n", "correct": true}
